        "text": "This is a very convenient way to keep all your gardening tools handy. It's similar to the bucket tool caddies that contractors used with one key different -- there's no flap that goes inside the bucket, so it's possible to use the bucket to carry dirt, weeds, plants, etc. without getting dirt all over the caddy.Construction is decent. I had no problems fitting it to a five gallon bucket, but it's essential that you find one that does not have a lot of ribs around the lip. The caddy straps on with velcro, and the ribs would make it hard to get a good fit. Thus, buckets you buy at places like Home Depot will not work well - you need an old 5 gallon paint bucket for best results.There are plenty of pockets. The pockets on one side are closed at the bottom; the pockets on the other are open on the bottom. Chances are you'll be able to fit all the tools you want to carry. The only problems I encountered were with long handled weeders. I'll end up carrying them inside the bucket as before.The seed pocket (sort of like a wallet with cutouts to stash seed packets) is a nice touch but, alas, one that I can't use since I purchase most seeds in bulk bags not envelopes. Wish there was an option to remove that and replace it with a pocket suited for tools, but hey - at this price, I can't complain at all.My only concern is construction. While it is decent for the price paid, I expect it will be a bit ragged after significant use. Reenforced seams with rivets would be great - I'd be willing to pay a bit more for that. A better gripping mechanism would also be a nice touch - perhaps some type of spring clamp that grips the bucket so the burden of holding this on is not born by just a single piece of velcro. Lastly, a built-in sheath for a garden knife would be an excellent addition."

        "text": "I am relatively new to gardening and only had 2 old, cheap tools that I used to pot indoor plants. When I started vegetable container gardening, I quickly found that my old tools were not going to cut it, so I got myself a nice set of Fiskars tools. I then needed something to hold them and carry them in when I went back and forth to the garden, so I found this bucket caddy.I already had 5-gallon buckets as that is what I use for container gardening. It is tricky getting the caddy on right the first time. I found it easiest to lift the handle of the bucket up and then put the caddy on, being sure to align the openings on both sides of the caddy with the sides of the bucket where the handle connects. If you don't do this, you won't be able to use the bucket's handle, which kind of defeats the purpose of being able to carry your tools to the garden! Even after going through this process a few times, I still haven't mastered it, but I did at least get a tight fit of the caddy's \"belt\" onto the rim of the bucket. The handle is pretty much locked in the upright position, but that's okay with me because it makes it easier to grab it and go to the garden.There are loads of pockets of all sizes. They fit everything from my big round composite soil scoop (Fiskars 7068 Composite Soil Scoop) to a small pair of scissors I use for opening bags of soil and such. The caddy fits my Fiskars garden tools set plus several extra tools and there is still plenty of room for more.The material the caddy is made from appears quite heavy duty but, since mine is still pretty new, I can't speak yet to how well it will hold up over time.You might want to complete your bucket and caddy with a bucket seat (Custom LeatherCraft 1140 EasySeat Lightweight Plastic Bucket Seat for 3 1/2- 5 Gallon Buckets), as I did. I had hoped for it to be more flexible for comfort, but it is still great to be able to sit on the bucket and have your tools right under you so you can both reach for whatever you need and also easily put away what you're done with.Definitely recommend this Garden Bucket Caddy."

        "text": "...I thought this was a canvas bucket with a handle and didn't realize it was a canvas wrap around for a 5 gallon 'homer' bucket, which is not included.Tip for putting it on, unlatch the velcro strap and remove it entirely so you can slip the wrap under the bucket handle, not over it.  That might be why some people are having the velcro or seams tear, if you wrap it right around the handle and then raise the handle, that would put more stress on the strap.Once I wound this under the handles as pictured in the amazon image on the product page, rerun the strap and secured the velcro it was snug enough to put a bunch of tools in the pockets.  Which are big enough for tools you'd use to manicure plants, as opposed to hand shovels and the like.  Look at the photo and you'll see some regular standard scissors in one of the pockets, that should give you some scale.So nice that I have a big bucket to put stuff in, not so nice that its really made for rather small tools, not so nice that I had to go buy a bucket but that's my fault.  I own a ton of fiskars stuff and although I know their big business is scissors, I thought I was buying a yard tool caddy and not a scissors holder.I re-purposed it as a sprinkler/irrigation repair bucket, that's working for me."

It was the same back in Canada, at least the kill rate wasn't any better with the cartridges. The other down side to these (if they do have any effect) is that it's highly dependent on the direction and force of the wind.

So, one day we had beautiful, healthy blossoms on our newly planted flowers and the next all we had were stumps and a few small leaves left on each. Talk about being sad!After a relatively detailed review and possibilities, we decided on the Scarecrow. We ordered one and two days later via Amazon Prime it was assembled, in the ground and hooked up to the hose. Aside from inadvertently squirting myself a couple of times, I got used to sneaking up on it to turn in off in the early AM and on in the PM. After a few days I got the sensitivity right and for a week have not had any problems with deer.Convinced that the Scarecrow was the device for me, I then purchased a Gilmour 13 Brass 2-Way Connector for the faucet and an Orbit 62001 Lawn and Garden Digital Watering Timer. I'll have reviewed both of these separately.Suffice to say, I am extremely happy with the Scarecrow. It is better than any other device I can think of and, unless it breaks early in its life, will continue to receive a five-star review from me."

I could hear them scratching and squirming in the little den of theirs, which used to be part of my house.  I tried a \"coyote urine\" repellent  - without success.  I decided to give this Contech ScareCrow a try.  I erected it in front of the den entrance and turned it on just before midnight, when I was sure all the raccoons had left their den.  An hour later, it fired and I heard the sound of animal running away.  All was quiet afterwards.  The next day, I spent all day erecting another barricade - a much sturdier one this time, with grade A \" lumber, 1/4\" steel screws, and \" steel nuts and bolts.  I left the ScareCrow where it was, just for good measure.  During the week, the Scarecrow fired a couple of times during the night and that was it.  The raccoons never returned to attack the barricade again.The nature of and solution to animal problems vary extensively, but for the narrow purpose of keeping raccoons from getting into their den, this Contech ScareCrow passed with flying colors.  The whole unit is made of plastic; it may not last very long under the hot desert sun of the American Southwest, but it did work as it was supposed to right out of the box and setting it up was a breeze.  Other reviewers complained about short battery life; perhaps a lithium 9V battery may help."

        "text": "Cats just love nice soft planting bed dirt. Easy digging, no grass or leaves to work around and often plenty of room so they don't have to re-visit the same spot. They are indeed tidy animals. After preparing them for this year's planting, adding all sorts of expensive amendments, every day saw new cat diggings and poop. This year the beds are off limits.Set up the Scarecrow and not one cat visit to report yet. Well, they might of visited, but they didn't stay! I know it fired off at least once and while the water goes up some and doesn't actually hit them, it does make a sudden and fearsome noise and a lot of commotion and they want no part of that.Once I saw a mountain lion paw mark in one of my beds, so if it chases them away that might also be a good thing. Same for raccoons at the fish pond. And it does all this humanely.You do have to be careful to set the sensor low enough for cats and smaller animals. In the past I tilted a Scarecrow down so the sensor picked them up, but for deer or larger dogs you don't have to. With a raised bed it is easy to set up the height to just above ground level, but for a bed at ground level you might want to try setting it in a pit. You can't lean it over because it works by tracking animals walking across its path.It does not work on critters coming straight at or away from it. My outdoor motion lights are like that. You have to spend the time to find out the direction your visitors will travel and make sure they go across its path.The kick of the water will indeed knock it back so that it is pointed upward and this will make it useless. Really, you just have to attach it to a supporting post. I wired mine to the planter walls. I had one once that I put into a pot full of gravel and that did not work. Normal soil will not contain it either.So, spend the time to point it correctly and secure it. I find that going up half-way on the sensitivity works fine. You just have to test your situation (with the water off).You need a 9V battery as it does not ship with one.Years ago I had what seems to be the same device, a gift. It broke and the company would not answer an email about buying the part (solenoid). I hope things have changed and parts will be available. I do not like throwing away a $50 item that can be easily fixed.Hecho en China of course. Should be cheaper considering. Lost a star for that."

        "text": "I bought three of these to keep a local skunk out of our lawn before he/she manages to dig out all the grass.The PIR sensors inside the scarecrow barely detect a skunk - it's too low and slow to set it off unless its within a few feet of the sensor. However, the sensors do a great job of picking me up to 20' away. When an object is close, the water won't hit it, even on minimum range settings. What few drops are hitting the skunk, he/she simply shrugs off and keeps digging / eating.This 'scarecrow' works better repelling squirrels since they seem to set it off more easily (hopping through the grass) and because they seem to mind the water more.I like how the sprinkler head can be adjusted for range and scope of rotation (360 degree vs. a smaller sector, etc.). That allows you, within limits, to fine tune the area of coverage. The smaller the area of coverage, the more effective the scarecrow is, since the pest will be hit repeatedly as the stream whisks back and forth in a narrow arc. But that only works for alleys or other narrow confined approaches, not a open field.Another nice feature is how you can daisy-chain these scarecrows. The bottom has an inlet and and outlet that is usually covered with a cap. They even include sealing rings, so there is no leakage. However, I am not impressed with everything being made of plastic. The thing is fragile, as emphasized in the manual - no pushing, pulling, etc. on anything plastic other than the stake and then only around the garden hose fittings. For example, I accidentally dragged a hose across the top of one unit and the plastic distance dial popped right off.For $50+ I expect better and its claimed efficacy re: skunks is not borne out in my experience."

        "text": "I grow a lot of my own food and I keep a straw mulch of 12\" on top of the soil.  I also have five cats who love to play in the mulch; moving the mulch around - revealing the seeds to the sun or they go to the bathroom in it.  Was looking for an inexpensive way to keep them out. Electric fence will work but is time consuming and somewhat costly..When I put it up, using all the parts, it is way too high to detect cats. Not only that I couldn't get the water to spray down where it would actually hit the cats.  If you look at the picture above, the spray is \"above\" the cat.  That won't work with my cats - they'd just thumb their noses at it and continue on their way.  This thing has to soak them or they aren't going to leave the garden. So after fiddling with it for awhile, I finally stuck a piece off of a wooden clothespin in between the dial and the deflector and that got the spray closer to the ground.  But the whole thing is still too high.So I checked to see if a 1/2\" pvc hose thread fitting would work with the Scarecrow fittings and it did so I cut the long extension pipe down to size.  But they've made the pipe itself not a standard size - too big for 1/2\" pvc, too little for 3/4\" (what kind of company does that?).  So I sit there and scratch my head - looks like I will have to buy another extension pipe from the company.  But as I was walking by I looked at it and thought \"Now why can't I just screw the hose into the fitting where the hose attaches, then screw that directly into the motion sensor head.Eureka!  Victory.  So now the Scarecrow sits about 6 inches off the ground.However, there is still another problem with the design of this product.  The hose attachment piece does not have a swivel.  So unless you put a disconnect fitting on it you are going to have to uproot the scarecrow to be able to get the hose off easily.If I were the owner of this company I would include additional length extensions in different lengths and a swivel hose connector.  A good idea this product; but needs more forethought by the designers.  Afterall, this product isn't inexpensive really, especially if you need multiple ones."

Forget deer resistant plants, they will eat almost anything when they are hungry. What they don't eat, they destroy, pulling it up and spitting it out! We tried several chemicals including wild animal urine, without success. On the recommendation of a local landscaper we purchased the scarecrows and they really worked! They protected even the most tender (delicious) plants.After the warranty expired, a big buck, escaping the spray, stepped on a scarecrow and broke the spray head. I called the factory, (phone number and e-mail on the included brochure) and they promptly sent a reasonably priced replacement.Recently, after six years of use, one unit was still working normally, but the other started spraying with a very small flow. I was prepared to buy a new one as we had several new tender plants that needed protection and I still needed both. However, I first tried again calling the phone number on the brochure, to my surprise it still worked! I talked with a very polite gentleman who suggested I try disassembling the unit and thoroughly cleaning the parts with a vinegar solution, he would e-mail the instructions. He did, and I cleaned it following the very clear (with pictures) instructions. It wasn't that hard and the scarecrow worked like new!

Before I got five of these sprinklers, he was killing several birds a day.  In the seven months I've had the rainbirds scattered around my backyard, he hasn't had a successful hunt.  Nor has he been able to spend enough time in my backyard to leave presents for my dog to find.  The sprinklers do not react to birds, but the cat hasn't figured out a way to avoid them. Each time he moves out from under a bush, he gets blasted by a rainbird.  He jumps the fence and runs away only to return the next day hoping for a different outcome. When I first installed them I had a problem with leaks, but after wrapping the connectors with plumbers tape, there have been no drips whatsoever.  I like that the water jet can be aimed high or low, so my windows remain dry when the sprinkler goes off. The water jet is pretty powerful and very loud, so be sure to direct each rainbird so you can sneak up behind it to turn it off.  Even when the water is turned off at the spigot, enough remains in the hose to give you a good soaking.  Embarrassing to admit, but both my gardener and I have been sprayed more than once.

        "text": "I bought this unit last summer to deter cats from attacking the birds in my back yard.  I have several feeders in my yard, and in the summertime when the bushes and ground cover is heavy, several cats in the neighborhood hide in the brush and very often leap out and nail birds that are ground feeding.  I can't tell you how many times I have gone out there some time during the day to see a pile of feathers on the ground.  Sometimes I am fortunate enough to catch them hiding and I chase them off.  But I can't be back there all the time. Both me and the birds were losing the battle big time for a while. I even resorted once to laying down one of those sprinkler hoses and leaving it on low all the time.  But that was wasteful and expensive...This sprinkler thingy has been a Godsend to me and the birds.  It's so easy to hook up.  You just put a battery in it, attach a hose to it and stick it in the ground.  Its that simple.  I bought two of them for the bushes on each side of my fence and installed a Y connector in the hose so it can deliver water both ways.  It takes a while to get the sensitivity just right, but then its just sit back and watch it patrol the grounds for you.  Since I have had it installed I have not seen the remains of a single victim.  And the burst of water that is left behind is useful to the birds and harmless to the cats. It's true that you have to have a hose running across your yard for it to work, but that is a minor irritation for what you get out of it as far as service for sure.  When I first installed it I saw the area wet all the time as the cats were taking their chances with it.  Now its less and less being used as they have become wise to it and moved on to other game somewhere else.  It's true that the battery doesn't last as long as one would want, but I really don't mind it.  I just change it at the beginning of the month from late spring through September whether it needs it or not and its up and working without interruption.In conclusion, this is one of the cheapest, if not the cheapest form of motion detector sprinkler I have found on Amazon. It installs in a jiffy, works perfectly for me, and seems very well made.  I can't attest to its durability yet, but for the price and performance I highly recommend it.  Great product.. : )"

All of the various repellents, sprays, dangly-things, and even electric fencing, only held Bambi and Bambi's mother off for a week at best, then they would either get used to them or (in the case of fences) just jump over them.They can't seem to get used to this Scarecrow though - I guess it's just too unpredictable for them.  It held them off all season and I actually got veggies from my garden, whereas my neighbors got nothing but deer-droppings.So I'm here to order another this year, to protect my flower garden as well.  (I'm also considering using one to ward off pumpkin-stealing pranksters at Hallowe'en - that ought to be a good \"treat\"!)  Oh, yah- that reminds me:  don't set this device up where the mailman has to cross its path.  Mail carriers can get a little grumpy about being squirted with water out of the blue - go figure... :)--- Just editing this a year later to add: Not only is it still working (imagine that: getting an electronic product out of the potting shed after winter is over, putting in new batteries, and it STILL WORKS!) but the deer are also still completely put off by it.  Can't ask for better than that!"

I have deer, chipmunk, turkey, and the most annoying, ground hogs.  This works for all of them.  Just set the sensitivity to the right setting.  Don't jack up the setting too high, otherwise, it'll go off a lot.  Not sure why other reviews say the battery runs out fast which I was worried about but I've had it going for about a month with the product going off several times a day without any issues with the battery.  Perhaps they jacked up the sensitivity to the top.  The only downside is based on the size or layout, you may need to get several of these to keep out the animals.  I have a garden about 50 x 20 with 2 tiers and tall plants so I needed at least 4 to get a good coverage.  Amazon has the best price so get what you need for your garden and keep those pesky animals away!"

I placed it facing the parts of the yard where the deer trails end.  Heard it go off during the night a few times during the first week, followed by the sound of snorting and stamping deer.  For the first time in years my yard is not a deer buffet--as a matter of fact NOTHING in my yard has been browsed this year.  So glad to finally see some perennials that I haven't seen in five years.  I have tried all kinds of things in the past to deter them and nothing works.  If you have deer problems I highly recommend giving this a try.  If only there was something for winter (besides deer netting)."

        "text": "I was having a problem with a groundhog that was loving some of my cabbage plants to death (literally). He ate three to complete stumps in two days and was working on his next one when I got this in the mail.I anxiously set it up and learned much about it in the process. I see most of the people here praising it for getting rid of deer, and it may work well for that because they are large targets. It also does disturb smaller varmints but not in the way I expected.Thie product is very difficult to review because while it works somewhat,  a 60 dollar product is not necessary for smaller, less intelligent and less numerous pests.  It is probably great for an area infested with pests though, hundreds of deer or tons of groundhogs, but something much simpler could be used in your average garden setting.The idea of the product is cute and simple enough. It is a motion sensor attached to a sprinkler. If the Scarecrow sees anything that moves, it fires the sprinkler off for about five seconds. It then waits 8 seconds and repeats.The problem is that with smaller varmints, they can hide behind the plants, and when the Scarecrow is aimed low, every plant movement (breeze blowing a cucumber leaf) sets it off unless you turn the sensitivity down so far that it won't go even off with you dancing in front of it.When set to scare away smaller pests, this device falses constantly on plant movement and only sees the varmints if they are totally exposed in front of it, which rarely happens in my garden jungle. The motion sensor concept doesn't work well because everything moves in the garden including the plants. It has a false detector that suppoesdly automatically shuts down the sensitivity if it is falsing too much. It doesn't work well. We have watched the Scarecrow go off every 10 seconds for an hour non-stop with nothing in front of it but plants moving in a very light breeze.The good thing, and the dichotomy for me, is it appeared to get rid of the pest. We have not seen the groundhog since and my few cabbages left are doing OK. So for that, I wanted to give it a much better rating than I otherwise would. The sprinkler does appear to scare away most animals, but it cost me $60 to save $10 worth of cabbage.Cats, dogs, groundhogs, squirrels, rabbits, etc. appear to be driven away by it. And the battery has lasted several weeks. I just can't give it anything but one star because it doesn't work the way it claims and is very expensive for the average Joe. The device works more like a random sprinkler shooting water at random time intervals depending on the breeze.A better product, and one that is actually affordable, would be one you set up that randomly fires a sprinkler every few minutes.  It would be much cheaper and just as effective.  You may be able to recreate it with a timing device that runs on a battery and a $7.00 sprinkler, or just a generic timed sprinkler you use when you notice a pest is bugging your plants. But if you have tons of deer, then this may be your only viable solution short of a major fence or wall.There is another reason the product is very annoying. You have to have it hooked up to the hose all the time. I have to have a hose reeled out across my lawn at all times to reach the garden from the water faucet on my house. It is in the way much of the time, so has to be moved about all the time for family gatherings, lawn mowing, kids want to play in yard etc. But I did discover an alternate use!! Kids love running in front of the Scarecrow. :-) OK, now would you pay $60 to entertain your kids?  OK, so sell it as that.  Much more useful for that purpose.If marketed as a garden tool, the motion sensor should possibly be a heat sensor or something that can discern better between mammalian presence and a leaf in the wind. The sprinkler is little more than a cheap lawn sprinkler attachment. I am very torn in my rating because here is a device that basically did what I wanted it to do, scared away a varmint eating my plants. It has a major cool factor and is a fun conversation piece loved by the kids. But it falses constantly and is difficult to deal with unless you want to run an underground hose to it and it is expensive.I am giving it one star because it works, kind of, but it is not what it advertises itself to be.  A motion sensor cannot work in a dense garden for small animals.BUT YOUR KIDS WILL LOVE IT!  This would get 5 stars as a kids' toy!!  So maybe as a combinational use product it gets more stars?"

Because of this we attract colonies of rabbits and they are killing our yard and eating everything I try grow. I recently planted some clover seed to fill in the patches of grass their urine has killed, but the whole task would be useless had I not found the Scarecrow sprinkler. I'm happy to report this has almost completely solved our problem. We have been keeping the sprinkler pointed towards the section we are repairing and the clovers are coming in undisturbed. However, there are blind spots as the sprinler cannot see off to the sides very well. Now the rabbits are hanging around the other half of our yard. Solution- we will definately be getting another one of these for the other half. One annoying thing about the Scarecrow is they didnt include a ring to were you attach the hose to make attaching and unscrewing easier; you have to twist the entire sprinkler around making lining up the threads kind of a pain. Regardless this is has been the best rabbit repellent I could find. I highly recommend the Scarecrow!"

I wanted to aim it at the base of some bird feeders which a raccoon raids every night (climbing over the raccoon baffle), but it was going over the entire feeder from about 10' away. (Minus one star.)Next, I tried moving it to a flower bed where an armadillo often digs, but even putting it on the downhill edge of the bed and slanting it down as much as I could while still being able to get the stake into the ground, the spray was still too high and WAY too long. (Minus one star for not being able to scale down the spray distance to below 15'.)On the positive side, the device uses an infrared sensor, meaning that it keys on moving heat, so that branches blowing in the wind should not set it off. (Add back one star, since the cheapy alternative would have been a simple motion detector.)I'm hoping that having the spray go over the armadillo's head, plus the noise, will be enough to scare him off, but I would have preferred to have it actually hit him with a direct blast of water."

But it was the sweet potato vine in the pot near the porch that was my call to action.  I purchased one of these Scarecrow motion sensor sprinklers that will scare the deer away and installed it a few weeks ago.  Although I&#8217;ve never seen it in action, I know it works.While I was out of town moving the family down, there was some work being done at the house.  I was texting with one of the folks working around noon one day and I mentioned the sprinkler as a warning.  Shortly thereafter I received the following text from another worker, who was also at the house helping:  &#8220;Hello Tom.  Thank you for the warning about the sprinkler.  I don&#8217;t know about deer, but it seems to work fine on me, the carpet cleaner, and the landscape crew.&#8221;  That&#8217;s how I knew it worked at first.But, as it turns out, it's not just great on contractors!  It also keeps the deer away.  After installing it, I noticed no further damage except when I would forget to turn it on.  I use a timer with it so that it does not spray our dogs during the day.  I've been using it for several months now and it still works perfectly.

That's because your basic flyswatter is incomplete since it requires a nearby flat \"killing surface\" to get the job done; if the flying bug in question refuses to cooperate by landing on or flying slowly near such a killing surface, a flyswatter is useless.On the other hand this tool can take care of insect pests flying in the middle of the room, next to things that cannot safely be swatted, or outdoors.  This particular model has a couple of buttons that must be pressed and held down simultaneously (by thumb and forefinger) in order to charge, which happens almost instantaneously, and a red LED to let you know it is ready, all of which contribute to extending battery life.  Despite my son's bug hunting safaris, I'm still on my first set of two AA batteries.  Use is basically the opposite of a flyswatter: move it slowly until the grid touches the insect pest (there will usually be a visible flash).  Cleanup in most cases involves wiping with a tissue.Obviously, the larger the bug, the less likely you will kill it outright with the first charge, but at the very least this thing will knock it to the ground.  I would not advise seeking out combat with a swarm of hornets, but this tool would be about the only effective response in addition to running for cover.

I change the batteries maybe once a year, and I rate this as one of my best purchases ever.  My husband likes it too because with this racket I can tackle the spiders in our house on my own.  Very happy, especially considering the inexpensive price.**Original review**I live on a couple acres in the woods, complete with creek.  My targets include gnats, mosquitoes, flies, moths, spiders, and perhaps the occasional wasp.  Gnats are vaporized, moths give a gratifying spark and perhaps a wisp of smoke when they hit the racket, and dead mosquitoes get stuck to the racket but are easily shaken off.A few nights ago, a big housefly got inside our home and I grabbed the racket to take care of him.  He flew into the racket as I held it over him near the window and zapped him easily.  This morning, I accidently let in a huge moth that promptly headed for the nearest lamp.  I carefully stuck the racket under the lampshade, and the moth flew right into it.  I can't imagine how difficult it would have been otherwise to get rid of that fly and moth without the racket.I love this racket for taking care of spiders too!The only negative I've noticed is that when I'm wildly swinging this zapper around to see how many gnats I can kill, the battery cover slides a little.  Not a big deal to me.  If I'm not swinging it wildly, the battery cover doesn't budge.I picked this bug zapper over the other oh-so-similar racket zappers available because this one only has horizontal zapper wires in the racket area..... no protective mesh that might interfere with eliminating pesky bugs.**Update** August 2009: I've owned this racket for over 18 months now with frequent use, and someone requested a specific update about a couple of common problems with this racket, so here it is!  Regarding having to press on two buttons to use this racket, I'm glad of this feature because it reduces the likelihood of it bumping up against something in storage and accidentally being turned on.  The buttons are staggered on each side of the handle so that my thumb is on the upper button, and my index finger is on the lower button.  I have to take 1/2 a second to make sure my fingers are in the right place and the little LED light is on and working, but it doesn't bother me.  The buttons are a safety feature and I'm willing to work with them.  Regarding the battery cover, it sometimes slides about 1/2\", but it has never slid off completely so I don't worry about it.  I'm STILL on the original set of batteries this zapper came with.  :)  If this racket zapper ever stops working perfectly, I'll update, but so far it really has exceeded expectations."

It wont kill a person, but it does hurt, which is a strong indication of its effectiveness against the much, much smaller insects. They dont always die first zap, but it always stuns them at the least, allowing you to toss them outside or dispose of them however you see fit.A good way to spend $10 IMO."

It works with either an open pile or compost apparatus.Composting is not terribly complicated, get the right nutrients (yard waste), the right amount of water, the right temperature, the right amount of air, and the right bacteria; and that yard waste will decompose to something wonderful for your garden. The scary part with composting, if a few of those elements are off, the compost pile ends up smelling really bad. This ringer product helps get the bacteria side of the equation working right. You still have to water the pile during dry periods, aerate the pile, and add material to the top. It isn't a magic wand that takes the every other day tending out of the equation.The bacteria that decompose yard waste are already present in those leaves, grass clippings, and wood chips. It is just at a very low level. Ringer Compost Plus boosts the bacteria count quickly and gets the compost pile working much faster than if left to its own devices. In theory, applying this once should do the job, just like sourdough bread. In practice, I end up getting lazy with my compost pile and let things run crazy. Ringer's bacteria are also chosen to work at higher temperatures, meaning the compost pile will decompose quicker.Ringer's yard products are amazing. I've used their Lawn Restore fertilizer for a long time. Unlike synthetic fertilizers with really high nitrogen and phosphorus levels, this is a gentle fertilizer. I'd have to work hard to get my lawn to stripe or look uneven from this fertilizer. There is also a blend of bacteria in the fertilizer that makes my lawn a lot healthier. The product is organic, but that's not why I buy it. It just makes my lawn look great in a gentle way. Their Compost Plus hasn't changed a lot over the years either. It is the old reliable product it always was. Ringer products are not easy to find - the fertilizer is very expensive to order on line. Safer Brand is the main company. I've seen their products in Do It Better and Ace Hardware stores. I haven't seen it in the big box home repair centers.Compost Plus is a great way to get that compost pile working."

When growing compost, you have to be serious:  About your ingredient mix and about turning and churning up your mix.  You have to be patient, too!We are diligent about our composting:  We have 1 1/2 acres of manicured lawn, many gardens, many trees and bushes and a free-range chicken yard.  So we need a lot of compost and we generate a lot of compost material.  We use a double-barrel Mantis for our composting:  It makes the turning and churning a breeze.  But we really need to make a lot of compost to capitalize on the Mantis investment.Even with all the great compost material we generate, we still need an accelerator every once in a while--especially during colder months. And then sometimes our mix of \"green\" and \"brown\" material is not quite right.  Sometimes we just want compost fast--well, at least faster than its normal slow-but-sure progress.  We always have a box of this stuff on hand.Just an extra thought that may prompt someone to get into composting:  Even with our Mantis compost-maker, we still have compost makin's left over.  So we bought a roll of plastic fencing and made a triangle using the fencing on the inside corner of a chain link fence.  We dump our grass clippings and leaves into this simply-made 8'x8'x8' triangle.  When we first dumped a partial box of this Ringer compost-maker onto our 5' tall pile, it fell 1 1/2' within a week.  So, do not doubt that it works.  Also, you can simplify your composting efforts--it's not the most efficient way to go, but it is better than no composting at all."

        "text": "I've always had a compost pile in the back corner of my yard and since I grow most of my own produce, it comes in handy to fill raised beds (certainly cheaper and better than buying soil) and to top-dress beds. The thing that convinced me to try this produce was that it is a 100% natural product and, as much as possible, I like to keep an organic garden. As an aside, I read Mike McGroatry's blog/website a lotEasy Plant Propagationand agree with him that compost isn't complicated--it's what nature wants to do with a pile of clippings. The best thing you can do is just get out of the way and let nature take her course. But you have to be patient (not one of my more stellar qualities).The problem I've had is that while I do get great compost/soil from the pile over the course of a summer, it's a slow process. With that in mind I decided to try this product. (I also thought of buying one of those tumbling things, but have you seen how much they cost?)I tried the product today. The instructions call for sprinkling about a cup on a pile that's about 3 x 4' and about 12\" deep. I had a freshly stacked pile of materials (both green and brown materials) that was about that size and 3' tall already, so what I did was spread it out and and then re-piled it but added a cup of the Compost Plus for every 12\" depth or so. I watered each layer (as per instructions) as I re-stacked the composting materials and built the pile back up to its original height. This sounds complicated, but it took all of 10 minutes. I just used a pitchfork and it was very easy work.I won't know for a month or so if this is any faster, but I'm hoping to see some evidence (heat perhaps) that this stuff is speeding up the process. I may even be able to tell sooner than that. One thing I got from the packaging was that it's important to have a good level of moisture in your compost pile--not too wet, but certainly not dry. I have been remiss in that--again, I just let the rain water it normally. I will try to be more careful about keeping this pile wet to give the product a fair chance. If it works and speeds up the process, I'll be thrilled. I'm reading a lot lately about the value of microorganisms in soil (and reading a lot about no till gardening)Plowman's Follyand that is what this product is: a mix of select microorganisms.I will update this review in a few weeks and report back on how its working. My only negative thought now is that it took most of the 2 lb box to do the pile (again, 3 x 4') and so adding this stuff regularly adds another expense to the garden.Update 5/09/2013: It's only been a few weeks since I first applied this stuff to my compost pile and while I don't feel the \"heat\" that I was half expecting, I will say that the pile seems to be composting faster than normal. I'm seeing a significantly faster conversion to compost in the center of the pile. Not a miracle, but noticeable."

Then you wait, sometimes for a year, for your compost.This product speeds up the process a little bit. It has a mild manure smell that did not bother me when I was storing it in the garage before use, but the smell did bother my nose-sensitive mother, who wanted to know what 'that stink' was. So for storing inside, be aware others might find the scent offensive. I'd suggest just using it right away. :)The pellets are really just a kickstarter product, with enzymes and flora to make the compost process hotter more quickly.

Since I've had little success with growing anything edible in the garden, I figured I'd give composting a shot, with the hope of livening up my roses (the one thing I can grow because I pretty much leave them alone except for pruning the bushes a couple times a year).I started my compost pile about a month ago, and I have to say, it's been fairly successful. It definitely has the strong, \"earthy\" scent one expects from rotting fruits, veggies, and garden cuttings. It's definitely doing something to the stuff I've been adding to the pile--coffee grinds, egg shells, fruit peels, veggie trimmings, dead plants, leaves, etc.The thing is, I don't know how much this compost additive is responsible, if at all, for the results. I think I probably would have had a pretty ripe compost pile anyway, but I just don't know. What I will say, though, is that I don't see any mold or mildew or anything else that would prevent me from continuing to compost.One thing I will suggest if you're new to composting, as I was just a few weeks ago, is that when you start your pile, you need to start with some variety in terms of size and waste. However, make sure you don't leave anything that's too big. I started with the branches I trimmed from my rose bushes. I should have probably cut everything down to no larger than 6 or 8 inches long, but I've got a few branches that are over a foot, and I don't know if it's because of the number of branches (they started out as about half my pile) or the size of the branches, but they are very difficult to turn with the other stuff I've got in the compost box. I thought about cutting them down, but given the effectiveness of the heat and sun (and the Ringer), I'm not willing to touch it with my hands (gloved or not).I know I've got a ways to go before the compost pile will be ready to apply to the rose bushes or the fledgling garden, but I'm looking forward to doing an update then."

I've not had very dramatic results composting in the bin by itself - it just seems to not decompose very quickly, despite following the general directions for this process.  So I thought perhaps this additive would speed things up.When I first received the Ringer product, I sprinkled a good cup or two into the compost pile as is.  It was going to rain the next day, so I didn't water it in.  I have noticed so far that the pile seems to have sunk more than what I'm used to seeing.This Ringer stuff smells like a barn, uh, natural fertilizer if you will.  While the cardboard box helps reduce the odor somewhat, I decided to store this in a tightly lidded plastic container, so that I could keep this under my sink without the sink cabinet beginning to smell.I keep a small bucket on my counter for compostible fruit/veggie pieces.  I have started adding a small scoop of the Ringer product to my bucket before I take it outside to the compost pile.  I use a plastic cup that comes with liquid laundry detergent, and I add what amounts to about a tablespoon.As I said, I'll update in 90 days to let you know how it continues to progress."

First, I examined the box trying to find ingredients, none of them was listed, so who knows what it is. It made me feel uncomfortable, because I do not know if it is there natural ingredient or some kind of chemical. Also, I would like to do some research on this product if it really works or not, but since there is no disclosure of ingredients, you stuck to \"take their word for it\". Plus, what if you have an allergy for it, but since their no information what inside; it can be a simple dust as far as I know.Second, I followed the directions and added this mystery chemical into my compost. I do not think it made a difference at all. My composter does its job with or without it just fine, it is black and generates a lot of heat, I water it or add greens to keep it moist, and turn it weekly. Did not feel any speed up whatsoever. Nature and composter do what they supposed to do without this gimmick. Don't waste your money!!.To speed up the composting and introduce viable bacteria, I added (as book on composting recommended) about a gallon of already made compost which already contains all the necessary bacteria and organisms, so they can start working on new pile of compost."

He started about 45 years ago and I learned from him. In order to compost well you must have oxygen, moisture, organic matter and the bacteria to break down the waste.Just as happens in any wooded area, all of these elements are present and occur in good time naturally. If you wish to speed up the process; it requires some work and the addition of micro-organisms. This is where the Ringer Compost Plus comes into the picture. Here is where the micro-organisms come from.Am I sure this product has all of the right organisms for my waste, how can one tell? Only time will be the judge. In from one to three months I can add to this review. I would add.... why would Ringer sell a product that will not work, since it is a product which is generally re-bought if it works well.Also,organic gardeners do compare notes.It is important to also make sure your compost gets the other things it needs. A rolling barrel can be purchased or just turn the compost pile periodically with a shovel and keep it moist. I do not like shovel work and I am cheap, so I made a composting unit out an old water well pressure tank that had failed. I mounted it sideways  on a simple 2x4 frame. It's about the size of an oil drum. I cut a door with a reciprocating saw, hinged it and added a latch. I added a shaft through the center that sticks out of the ends and they sit on the wood frame, (Like a hamster wheel). I can spin it to mix the compost which adds air and moisture through out. Maybe in 90 days I can give Compost Plus 5 stars."

It is a wonderful way to get rid of all the food scraps and peelings that you usually through in the garbage.There is more to composting than just putting scrapes on the ground you can actually use vacuum bag dust (if there is no food) I also put my hair cuttings, newspapers and leaves and grass clippings are also used. Letters and junk mail can be cut up and tossed in also.  All  you have to do is toss all of this once in a while and you come up with compost.  I am lazy I never turn my compost I leave it out and my chickens have a ball scratching up the compost.  I wind up having the best soil for the summer garden.Ringer 3050 Compost Plus is a great product it has lots of good micro organisms that literally eat up all the waste and turn it into compost.  Sure you can get a good soil without it but this product speeds up the porcess and adds lots of good organisms that add extra nutrishment to the mix.All you do is lay down the foundation and then add the amount  you need for the size pile you have, turn it a few times wet it down and within 3 months you start to see the results of the composting.  You can use the fresh soil for anything to grow, plants vegetables, flowers shrubs and even sprinkle it on the grass.."

        "text": "I've used this saw for several hours which is sufficient to give me an opinion as to its effectiveness and value. It's easy to set up, just use the wingnut clamp to secure it to the pole and off you go, no tools required. It stays put as does the extention of the pole. One easy to use clip on the pole allows you to move the extention in or out and lock it. It stays locked. Use it off the pole to trim off limbs from felled trees or easy to reach stuff. I've found many uses for the saw without the pole that makes to yard work go easy. It's safer than a gas chain saw and lighter. It is durable, it hasn't failed me. I maintain my machines and keep them ready to work, but I don't baby this saw or any piece of machinery. This saw does what it's supposed to without complaint. I pinched the chain in a limb (operator error!) and had to free it with another saw, but the Remington went right back to working without throwing a chain, bending, or breaking. Anyway you ...slice... it, using a chain saw to cut trees is tough on machinery. This saw has chewed through pine, oak, and cherry quickly and easily. When it's at full extention it's a little unwieldy because, afterall, you have a weight on one end of a pole and it will tend to be top heavy. But it is light enough to manuver and keep where you want it to cut and I haven't found its balance to be a problem. It does leak chain oil. In the yard, who cares? In the garage, it can be messy. But also tells you in the manual that it will leak the chain oil and recommends that you empty the oil resevoir when you store the saw. It holds about 3 ounces of motor oil and draining the oil is a ten second operation. Not a problem. When in use, one push of the oiler cap before eash cut and it's happy. It has an aggressive chain tooth layout which helps to slice through even big limbs. It's a ten inch saw, if you need to cut 14+ inch limbs/trees, you'll need a heavier chainsaw that's designed for that purpose. If you use this saw for its designed use, you won't have any difficulty pruning or taking off fairly meaty limbs from a safe position. I recommend it."

I would highly recommend this product for anyone interested in a chain saw on a pole.Keys to keeping this working well is keep the chain oiled.

Balance is an issue. It gets pretty heavy balancing an electric saw on a long pole..2. Poor design causes wood debris to quickly accumulate in the gear area. As a result, wood chips need to be removed between uses. Failure to do this will cause the chain to slip off or damage the nylon sprocket that moves the chain..3. Chain guide bends when the chain is tightened. As a result, an accurate cut is almost impossible..4. The tightening screw comes off very easily due to vibration during usage. After losing it, the only way to tighten the chain is to unscrew the two bolts holding the metal chain guide, move it forward, and retighten the two bolts with one hand while maintaining pressure on the other..5. The unit is underpowered. Eight amps is not enough for cutting large branches..6. It is very cheaply made. For example, the chain guide is thin. As a result, it bends to the side. Second, the gears and sprocket are made of plastic or nylon and will wear away in short time. Third, the oil reserve is a small squeeze bottle that is useless. It does not hold enough oil and needs constant refills."

It was not until I sprayed the yard with Cutter Bug-Free BackyardCutter Bug Free Backyard 32 oz Ready-to-Spray Hose End Insect Repellent Concentrate HG-61067, that I finally got rid of the mosquitoes.I did not like this product for many reasons:  it had a high initial cost, it required replacing the Octenol attractant (more $$), and the propane tank needed refilling about every 3-4 weeks (more $$).  In addition, it needs an electrical cord plug-in nearby, and one has to replace the mosquito catch nets (more $$).  Basically, it costs too much to operate, takes too much on-going maintenence time and effort, and most importantly, it did not eliminate the pesky mosquitoes!  So now I have two of these things taking up space in my shed.  I will not sell the devices because they simply do not work to control mosquitoes.

The rotating head came in handy when I trimmed around railroad ties. The blades are already grass stained after being used for approx. 20 min. It's suggested that you clean the blades after each use & oil them once in a while for longer life.

This is mostly because the lopper is designed with some large \"gearlike\" teeth, which act to increase leverage, and direct the applied force to the cutting surfaces.  This results in a tool that is generally more efficient and requires less effort, than most conventionally designed cutters, where brute force is usually required to cut through thicker or harder objects.According to the information on the product page, the maximum capacity is a diameter of 1.5 inches.  So far, I have used the PowerGear only on shrubs and small trees, with branches that are about an inch or less in diameter.  It has no problems cutting through either softer branches, or harder dried out ones.  Because the lower cutting edge is curved, you can't always go straight in, and cut where you want.  You may need to alter your approach, and come in at an alternate angle, in order to make the cut.  This can be slightly inconvenient, but you will learn to work around it.If you are used to applying massive force when using a cutter, you may be pleasantly surprised by the PowerGear, as it usually makes the task easier, and seldom becomes a physical struggle.  The blades are supposedly coated with a non-stick substance.  I'm not sure how long this lasts, but so far the blades have been relatively easy to clean.The blades are described as being \"razor sharp\" and \"precision ground\", but that's mostly promotional hype.  The blade is certainly sharp, but I was slightly disappointed at the uneven cutting edge on my blade.  The feel of the plastic handles is just adequate, as they don't provide an especially secure grip, something that can be important, when you are wearing work gloves, which can be slippery.A particularly strange oddity concerns the color of the blade.  My blade is black, but in some photos the blade is sliver colored.  I have no idea, what difference this may make, but the lack of standardization just seems strange.There are several versions of the PowerGear lopper, so you may want to check for the one that best suits your needs.  This one is for mid-sized branches, that are within easy reach.  Usually priced at about $25, I had to wait for some time before I was able to buy this cutter for just $18.  If you see it at that level, you might want to act fast, as it probably won't be there for long.  Like most Fiskars products, this one is fairly well designed and a solid value."

        "text": "These are designed to cut far more easily than your garden variety loppers, and they do just that. It says right on the handles that they cut \"three times easier,\" and indeed they do. You want a tool that does the same amount of work with 1/3 the force on the handle side. Since work equals force times displacement, you need to triple the displacement of (amount you open) the handles, and you will get the same amount of work done with 1/3 the amount of force. Since the blade is moving effectively 1/3 the distance you'd expect for such a large movement of the handles, it's providing three times the force, allowing you to do what really amounts to the same amount of work, but with what feels like 1/3 the effort.Since the blade, when closed, looks to be at somewhere near a 30 degree angle compared to the handle, and when opened, appears to be at around a 90 degree angle, the gears are accomplishing exactly what is needed to do what they claim. It's not a marketing claim. It's not a matter of what it feels like subjectively. When they say that it cuts three times more easily, it's an objective fact.The only possible down side is that if you need to work close and have limited room for handle movement, the blades won't separate enough. But for pruning trees, that's probably a non issue. They claim that it will cut branches up to 1.5 inches, and I concluded the same thing when I used them. But it will take the amount of force needed with other tools to cut a 1/2 inch branch. When I cut the largest branch I needed to cut using the maximum opening of the jaws (perhaps a bit more than 1.5 inches) it did take effort (but not struggle) to close the handles. But on branches of an inch or less, I've had more problems cutting paper with school scissors."

It blends in well, and holds a heavy pot securely. It is not permanent - I had no problems removing it and repositioning it (after removing the pot, of course).On the downside, the construction quality for something that is going to be outdoors 100% of the time (and often wet from rain or water coming out of the pot) is not as good as I would have liked it to be. It's all steel (painted) held together with welds. My concern is rust - it would have been nice to have it be made of stainless, or have a plastic coating on the steel to help prevent/minimize rust. I'll certainly be bringing this indoors in the winter, and most likely will need to spray paint it regularly to keep it rust-free, especially where it may get scratched from a clay pot.But so far so good. It's a nice addition to the deck, and I very much like that it's secure but not a permanent installation."

There are three bolts and nuts to hold it together.The problem started for me on the install. My prefab (plastic) railings are just a hair too wide to use the short side of the L bracket so if I use the long side of the bracket it sticks out into the basket area by inches. Which means that any flower pot put inside is then hindered by the brackets taking up some of the valuable area to place your pot. I also had trouble trying to tighten the nuts to keep it together since they are underneath the bracket arm. You have to tighten them and then put it back on the railing.There is a part that rests against your banister to keep the basket in a level position.It's nice but not great.

Since it can be adjusted fairly tightly on the ledge, it won't fall down, and the plant will not accidentally topple over the way it would if I just placed it on the balcony ledge without a pot holder. Staggering the plant pot heights from high to low allows each plant to have an individual focal point, and the pot holder sits up the highest on the ledge so that's great.The holder is easy to adjust with a variety of three holes per side and screws to secure it.  However, my balcony ledge is a little wide so I can only use one screw per side.  That isn't really a problem since my pot is balanced correctly thanks to the pot's non-tip bumper in the back bottom of the holder.  Also I like the fact that the holder is light weight and black is preferable, though it also comes in white. In addition, it is easy to move around or change the position of the pot and readjust the screws.

The paint and fittings appear to be weather resistant- so I don't anticipate anything rusting out.  The wire frame is heavy enough to adequately support a pot, soil and plant.  The mounting system is designed well, I hung this on my deck rail and feel comfortable it will be good there.  It looks nice and the black color I choose doesn't conflict with anything.The negative is in the hardware.  I don't want to be too insulting, but it literally looks like someone at the factory said, \"hey, we've got a bunch of these- use them!\"The hardware consist of flat head slotted screws that come up through the bottom of the part of the frame that goes over the rail.  That seems like a good idea, except the bottom of the frame is an non-camferred slot- so the screws stick out.  The nuts on top are plastic acorn nuts that don't have a metal inside.  This makes them easy to cross thread, easy to over tighten and generally, difficult to deal with.  It seems to me that a combination of a carriage bolt (so you didn't have to hold the bottom, it would hold itself) and a better nut could have made this so much easier to deal with.So, maybe what I'm saying is that this is a perfectly acceptable hanger- but that its harder to deal with then it should be."

        "text": "As an avid gardener with a deer problem, most of my plants are in hanging baskets and I was really hoping this flower pot holder would expand the possible places that I could use for more new plants.However with the rather limited ability to adjust the support of this flower pot holder, I quickly found that I would actually have to buy some lumber and add a wider board to either my fence or my house to accomidate the CobraCo holder.The package states to use the short end of the enclosed L shaped clasp for 2 to 4 inch railings,but actually it will not go below 2 and 2/4 inches, so the claim of wood top railings up to2 and 3/4 inches is actually incorrect, this flower pot holder will not fit on anything smaller than2 3/4 inches.Of course, now that I know that, I had to reconsider where to put it as my fence railingsare the standard 2 inch wide boards that are actually 1 1/2 in (38 mm) wide. Dimensional lumbersizes are calculated from the size of the green wood, which shrinks as it dries.Recommendation, mixed feelings here, if you have a deck with wide enough railings, this would work well, but for most fences it would not work."

        "text": "This is a substantial, yet almost invisible pot holder. Come to think of it, though, I have a light pot and plant in it; if I had this attached to a railing on a second story or higher railing, I would think twice about placing a heavy pot in it for fear that it might break and fall. I like it fine on our first floor railing.The nuts to adjust the holder could be better. I would suggest using stainless steel wing nuts--or even plastic with brass thread insert knobs--to replace the acorn nuts. Even with those changes, this is still a reasonably-priced plant pot holder."

When you hang this on a railing the flower pot holder is held securely thanks to two brackets and a bottom overhang.There are three screws on each side of the top of the flower pot holder.  There are two brackets that the screws hold.  On the bottom of the flower pot holder there is a four and a half inch by two and a half inch overhang on the back of the holder. The brackets and the bottom overhang secure the flower pot holder in place.The instructions say this will work on iron, aluminum and wood top railings up to 2 3/4 and wooded 2x4 and 2x6 railings.  It fits up to 10 inch pots.This is sturdy and seems like it is made to last."

        "text": "This adjustable flower pot is very easy to use. Just attach the L shaped brackets depending on the width of what you are hanging it on. It is best on something like a deck railing as the top of this will be about level with the top of the railing so most what you will see is the plant. It could be used on a fence too but may be a bit too high."
