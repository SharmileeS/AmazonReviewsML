It is great in a pinch and I will keep it to use during power outages but I had my cell phone hooked up for a couple of hours and it was charged enough to turn it on.  Also, I would have liked better documentation for a product of this price.  There aren't many instructions and they are printed so tiny they are hard to read.  I like that it charges AA or AAA batteries.  Only the AA are included.  I also like the flashlight feature.  All of the cords, battery charger, etc. fit nicely in the zipper mesh pouch and the whole thing folds up for convenient storage.

The size is OK like a large text book but definitely not as heavy. It worked as advertised. It's good to have for emergencies or if your going to be out doors for a few days.I gave it 4 stars because I prefer when my portable charging devices have several ways to be charged in-case the sun is not feeling cooperative. So it will not be replacing my Ambient Weather Emergency charger since it has solar/hand crank/battery/AC/DC/USB ect and also functions as radio/flashlight ect.So great to have compact user friendly and pretty efficient just not the best option for our emergency bug out bag. We have various back up power sources and this is one of the better ones...recommended."

This is a nicely built kit consisting of a lightweight solar panel (&#34;Nomad 7&#34; which is a nominal (in full sun) 7W panel), a battery pack (&#34;Guide 10&#34; which is a 4xAA battery holder with 10Ahr of storage capacity when used with the 2500mAh AA NiMH batteries), 4 of those NiMH batteries, a USB cable, and an adapter to charge and use AAA batteries in the Guide 10.Okay, so if you charge those batteries up using the solar panel, you have a good emergency source of power for a USB chargeable phone or tablet. Additional parts, such as AAA batteries, and additional panels and interconnects are all available here on amazon. It's a nice looking system, light in weight, but seems pretty durable (I've carried the panel and batteries around in a backpack with no issue) and well thought through. It's not inexpensive though! And I suspect that you will be a lot happier with this if you think through your device battery capacity and the need for hours of full sun for a full recharge."

I am dinging it 1 star because it does not include a micro usb cable which is by far the most common for cell phones and tablets now a days.  I found it to charge up the included batteries fairly quickly via the solar panels.  The battery pack's built in LED flashlight is not great, but will do in a pinch.  Great for those of us that live in a sunny state.  Also the panels can  be hooked up in parallel if you have more than one."

First, the panels are light and flexible, which gives this unit a larger surface area for collecting those photons.  Next, it is designed to charge 4 AA rechargeable batteries (included, along with a AAA adapter), which gives this unit more flexibility in use.  Finally, it comes to a full charge relatively quickly (about 3 hours).I like this charger.  It does take up space, however, meaning you are not going to be hauling it around all the time.  And a battery charger that can be plugged in a 110 V outlet is not very expensive.  You need to make sure this unit really fits your specific needs.  If it does, great.  It may not if you are better served by a less expensive, smaller model.  Think carefully before you buy."

This charger is light and folds up flat.  It comes with four rechargeable AA batteries. AAA batteries will also fit in the charger.The panel size when spread out in the sun has more surface area for the money than similar priced chargers.

I did like that the battery charger has its own light which is good for emergencies and that it has a USB port to directly charge other items from it.  (I understand it is actually better to charge items other than the batteries directly from the battery charger and not directly from the system itself because the battery charger regulates the energy flow.

I tried out the Goal Zero 41022 Guide 10 Plus Solar Recharging Kit from Amazon Vine, and it fits the emergency niche perfectly.The solar panel can be used to charge the battery pack (which is then used to charge devices), or you can charge the device directly from the solar panel. Living in Oregon makes the charging a bit iffy, but it does work... eventually. :)  The total stored power in the battery pack is around mid-range when it comes to the various chargers I use. I got a couple of full charges on my iPhone, and it slowed down the power draw on my iPad (not good for a full recharge there).For an ordinary travel bag, I wouldn't use this as my main power backup. It's on the slow side for recharging, and the total capacity is limited. But as an emergency bag power supply, it's hard to beat. If you don't have power, your backup power units are useless once drained. Granted, you can't always rely on the sun to be out to charge the Goal Zero, but at least it's a possibility. I can see this being the difference between &#34;life and death&#34; in longer-term disasters if it comes to needing to contact outside help.It's definitely not a cheap option, but in the middle of an emergency, I think it's well worth the price.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review ProgramPayment: Free"

        "text": "QUICK UPDATE:  We've had a rough winter, and there were some days when my feeders were inaccessible to me.  As a result, this feeder was the only one with seed in it for awhile.  The birds should have been pretty desperate for a meal with all the snow cover and sub-zero temperatures, but they weren't desperate enough to empty this feeder.  I can't account for this, but it's a big strike against the feeder.This is a decent-looking feeder (more attractive than its picture, in my opinion), and the smaller birds like it okay, although it's not their first choice, and for some reason they like it less once the seed level has dropped to where only the lower half is filled.  It can't accommodate larger birds unless they are clingers (most aren't) because the \"fly through\" spaces don't provide roomy enough perching area.  I also don't see an advantage to encouraging small birds to sit in a spot where they soil the feeder and food while they eat.  It's not squirrel-proof by any definition, although it is squirrel-discouraging and slows them down enough that they will turn to another feeder if one is available.What will probably cost this feeder its place in the lineup here is the mess of filling it.  I made the mistake of filling it indoors the first time, yikes!  The seeds stream out nearly as fast as they stream in.  Even filling it outdoors where I don't mind some seed on the ground is too wasteful.  I'm not sure where the line is drawn between seed being easily extracted from the wire openings and seed spilling out, but this feeder errs heavily on the side of spillage.I do think it might work better with shelled peanuts and might appeal to woodpeckers with those, and I may try that at some point.  I have a Brome squirrel-proof peanut feeder now, and the birds' response to it is pretty lackluster (and filling it is a pain), so it will be interesting to see if the Fly-Through feeder is a better choice for peanuts."

My husband's least favorite feeder was the ball one that they kept getting stuck inside. He twice had to cut a squirrel we named &#34;Tubby&#34; out of the thing. At least that will not be an issue with this feeder! Anyway, on to the review:Positives:1. I like the idea of this feeder, the pass through holes are a neat idea.2. There appears to be decent spacing for medium to smallish birds to hold on and feed.3. This feeder is suitable for the black sunflower seeds we like to use. (Note: see spillage issue below.)4. The price is fair for this quality of feeder. (I would say it is designed to last no longer than a couple of seasons.)Negatives:1. I had not read the review about the bird with its foot caught nor the injured chickadee before I picked this up. If I hear a repeat of those events, I will update this review and will throw the thing away.2. My squirrels are not yet active but this feeder looks like it will be highly vulnerable to their shenanigans. I will observe them when they come back and update if this is in fact an issue.3. Filling this feeder is not easy,4. Seeds fall out of the feeder very easily.All in all, there are any number of decent feeders out there. I can't really recommend this one because it has too many issues and the reports of injury to our fine feathered friends are too problematic.Not Recommended."

After putting it out, I had birds all over it but then I already had a very active bird feeding \"post\" with four different feeders.  I don't know if it attracts squirrels or not - my post is not near any trees and has a shield on the bottom to make it squirrel-proof.  The product page suggests that you use sunflower seeds and there is a reason for that - the holes in the feeder are huge and there is no bottom/pan so even the sunflower seeds fall out the bottom.  Consequently, this is probably the \"messiest\" bird feeder that I've owned.  I'd suggest you fill it with larger food like peanuts, but I'm not sure they would work as well.  If I could take it apart, I'd replace the wire mesh bottom with a metal pan in order to at least keep the sunflower seeds from raining out the bottom.Contrary to another Vine Voice reviewer, there ARE NOT pointy pieces of metal all over the feeder.  Not sure if she just got a bad one or she has an axe to grind (or I just got one of the \"good ones\"), but her story about the bird with the damaged wing appears to be anecdotal and/or wishful thinking.  So the feeder seems really neat - its a great idea to have the birdies climbing in and out of the feeder while you watch - but considering how much seed you'll lose, I'm not positive its super functional."

        "text": "This \"fly-through\" bird feeder is highly specialized in that it can only contain sunflower seeds and/or peanuts because the mesh holes are too large for mixes and smaller seeds. The birds that it attracts not only must like those seeds but must be able to cling to the sides since there are no perches.  For the first 24 hours, I didn't see a single bird eat from it even though they were emptying nearby feeders.  By the second day, some were brave enough to try it: titmice, chickadees, and house finches.  Now the birds will occasionally hit this feeder when the others are crowded.  Even though they seem to love sunflower seeds, they don't seem to love the feeder.  Well, all but one bird prefers the others.  When it's rainy, one male house finch goes inside the fly-through part to stay dry. Who would've thunk?The feeder is relatively easy to fill:  you hold in the catch above the roof and slide open the top.  The top doesn't move completely out of the way, so I have to be careful when filling it.  With the open mesh design, a lot of the sunflower seeds fall through as I'm filling it.  I have to scoop up the seeds and funnel them back in with my hands.  The feeder holds 2-3 pounds of seed.  The construction seems sturdy enough, although I'm concerned about other reports of bird injuries so I'm keeping a close eye on it.  I can't figure out how a bird would injure itself on the feeder since they are used to clinging and poking at things, and I don't see any exposed sharp edges.  Still, that doesn't mean it won't happen.The best thing about this feeder is that it actually manages to stay full longer than my other feeders because it attracts fewer birds.  If you have only one feeder in your yard, don't make it this one.  If you want a feeder to hold black oil sunflower seeds and/or peanuts and if you already have at least one other feeder, give this one a try.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"

It has been Over a week now and the birds still don't know what to make of this feeder.They just sit and stare at it, maybe pondering the fly-throughs on/in it?You can also, for lack of a better term, call this feeder a 'squirrel magnet' (something like a chick magnet!) The birds stay away in droves, but the squirrels love it.  They cling on to the wire and contort themselves into all kinds of odd positions to chow down on the  expensive black oil sunflower seeds I use in the winter.Since this feeder really doesn't hold all that much food, once the herd of squirrels are done  scarfing down  their little snack (it takes about 1 hour to do so), I find the herd with their noses pressed up against the deck sliding doors staring in at me as if imploring me (or trying to manipulate my mind) to go out and give them more hand-outs.I'm on to these little suckers finally, and I will no longer be brow beaten into submitting to the squirrels demands!I have moved this feeder to various parts of our yard and tried several different ways to hang it.

The design is unlike any of our other bird feeders, and the requirement of filling it with only large seed (smaller seeds, and even large ones, fall right through) promised to attract a different sub set of birds than we are used to.Filling is easy, as the top has just one button that frees it to slide along the hanger wire. Pouring in the black oil sunflower seeds was straightforward, but I recommend putting it on a flat solid surface to limit the amount of seed that falls out while filling. (There&#8217;s going to be a lot of leakage, anyway, so make sure you fill it outside in the vicinity of where it will be hung.) Once it was up, it was only a matter of a day or so before the birds found it and started using it. Lots of finches, grosbeaks, sparrows and cardinals use both of the fly through holes and the sides of the feeder. Mourning doves tend to hang out on the ground and eat what drops down. Several smaller birds spent many minutes sitting on the inside, eating. The most common behavior seems to be for the birds to sit in one of the holes and eat seeds from the outside of the feeder by sticking their head out. After two days, we noticed the birds came and went in waves based on our activity, however, this feeder attracts a lot of birds and has caused them to largely ignore our multi-seed feeder. The feeder was more than half empty in just three days. Also, I haven&#8217;t seen a single bird get caught or hung up in the feeder like other reviewers have mentioned.Because this feeder is all metal, I expect it will last a good while. It is well designed, and visually interesting. It does dump a lot of seed during the filling process, but most feeders do. Based on the large number of birds it attracts and the overall ease of use, I give it a full five stars."

Next, once the squirrels get a whiff, hang on it, do the hokey pokey and turn themselves around, the BOSS gets flung all over the place, to the hoard of squirrels waiting below.Finally, towards dusk, when the squirrels were tucking themselves into their nests, the cardinals came to investigate.  I was horrified to see a female get her claw stuck in it.  All her flapping around was stressful to us both.  I went over with the leather gloves and a towel, but by the time I got there, she probably broke her foot so that I wouldn't get her!  I took it down immediately.Should be starless!"

That however also means that the squirrels can get i easily and I assure you a couple swinging on this pretty much empties it in no time flat. It was also far lighter than I had hoped and I worry that the squirrels might be able to chew right through the mesh section. I hung it from the bottom of our deck now in hopes the little furry thieves won't be able to get a good enough angle to destroy it or swing the seeds loose again but I'll keep a close eye on how it's holding up, other reviews of injured birds also worries me and I wonder if possibly squirrels damaged those feeders first."

This might have worked if the mesh squares hadn't been so large!  The instructions suggest using only sunflower seeds or peanuts, since smaller seeds would fall through the mesh.  Well, sunflower seeds fell through the mesh, too!This thing is a mess to fill, since seeds pour out as you're trying to fill the feeder.  When I realized what was happening, I tried filling it over a cardboard box (to catch all the seed that poured out), but even once it was filled I saw that it was leaking seed all over the place.  I couldn't even carry it out to the tree where I was planning to hang it without seeds continuously leaking out from the sides and bottom.  The entire feeder is mesh, so the seeds come out everywhere.I have no idea how other customers were able to use this thing.  I gave up, since it was obvious that as soon as I hung it in the tree the seeds would leak out continuously until only the ground feeders would get any use from it.  It's possible this would work with peanuts, but I can attest that it's a failure with sunflower seeds.  This is a poorly designed bird feeder that wastes seed.  Not recommended."

The feeder gets a lot of clinging bird action, much more than other wired feeders in our yard.  The birds seem to prefer the fly-through openings, and they have no problems pulling out sunflower seed through the wires.  Squirrels extract seeds too, but with difficulty.  They can wriggle through two circular holes at once, with a tail poking out one end and a head sticking out the other.  While that's comical to watch, it's not fun seeing determined squirrels try to bend and break the wire mesh.  The feeder is now off-limits to them.I like the easy-fill cap, all-metal construction, and the fact birds can land anywhere to get a seed.  It does create somewhat of a mess on the ground, but that goes with the territory of bird feeding.  I never tire watching birds at this feeder, especially during wintertime when activity is high.UPDATE:  While the second feeder I just received resembles the first feeder in looks, it is apparent Perky-Pet has cut some corners.  The wire construction (particularly where connecting with the metal framework) is shoddy workmanship.  I can easily push the interior wires in (leaving an open gap).  They used to be solidly connected (soldered) to the metal square and circle framework.  Just imagine what a pesky squirrel could do with those wires now.  The wire itself is no longer coated either, so I wonder how long it will take before rusting begins.  The easy fill cap design has also changed for the worse.  My original feeder's roof clamped down on the body so no thieving varmints could pry it off.  This new one has one of those awful buttons that supposedly locks the roof in place, but every feeder I've used that has one operates poorly.I'm disappointed Perky-Pet took a good product and turned it into junk.  Even though my first feeder is a little beat up, I have the feeling it will outlast the second one I just received.  Five stars for an entertaining feeder that birds actively like and use, but two stars for inferior quality."

I have five feeders up, all have black oil sunflower seeds. They are all empty within two weeks... Except this one. I have yet to refill it. The birds seem to do their best to stay away from it.You can fill a feeder with bird seed but you can't make them eat it."

        "text": "I have had a similar feeder for several years.  It looks similar to this, but has only round holes (I like the round and square on this), a copper colored top, and a platform on the bottom.  I can't find it on Amazon to provide a link.  It has been one of the birds' favorite feeders, especially the chickadees.  I fill it with black oil sunflower seed and they like having all of the places to access the seeds.  I have trouble with deer in my feeders and they tend to leave these alone, possibly because tilting them does not allow all of the seed to fall out.  Although the feeders don't provide seed protection from the elements, they empty it quickly enough that it has never been an issue and I have never had a feeder filled with rotten seed.There are a couple of drawbacks with both feeders.  The &#34;fly through&#34; holes allow small birds to perch while eating, but they also take up a lot of space, so the feeder does not hold a whole lot.  The squirrels also can access the seed and they break the wire.  This makes it difficult to fill the feeder without losing lots of seed.  Even new a fair amount of seed comes out the sides, so I fill it over a platform feeder.  The platform the other feeder has on the bottom catches some of the seed that falls out during use.  This does not have the platform.  The other feeder's copper top is also more attractive than this plain black one.Still, this has quickly been just as popular with the birds as the copper version.  Due to the size of the holes, it is really only suitable for sunflower seeds in the shell, but that is the most popular seed in my area, so that is no problem.  I think other large seeds, such as safflower, might also work."

Also, it seems that sunflower seeds are the only type of seeds that might be good for this feeder, as the holes are a little too big for small seeds.  I haven't seen any birds fly through it yet, but I'll keep watch.  I have many bird feeders and I wouldn't count this one as better or worse than the others.UPDATE: I've had the feeder for a while now and I've been monitoring it closely (as closely as one can monitor a bird-feeder).  So far no mishaps with birds' feet getting caught, thanks goodness.  There has been a really great upside, which is why I changed my rating from four to five.  It just so happens that woodpeckers love this birdfeeder!  I've seen them hanging upside down from the bottom, (red-head and all!) with their long bill, poking into the holes to get out the seeds.  Another bird I see on it often is the Brown Thrasher, which happens to be Georgia's State Bird.  I'd never seen either of those birds close up, and now it's a real treat!  Bigger birds (like Blue Jays and big Cardinals) can't eat from it because their just too big to get a solid footing, but the baby birds hop in and out of the holes.One bad thing -- squirrels can hang on to this thing and feast away like there's no tomorrow.  They are responsible for eating about 80% of the seeds!"

It's a neat idea and its popularity is growing in our yard, but there are a few things to be aware of.  Because it's made of a large wire mesh, there's a considerable amount of spillage when you fill it.  So make sure not to try on a surface you'll have to sweep later.  Do it at the feeding area and the ground birds will thank you. And because the seeds are only held in place be a bit of friction, all you need to do is jar the feeder a little and it's snowing sunflower seeds.  Any squirrel worth his salt will figure this out in a few minutes--just jump against the feeder and you've knocked dinner loose for the whole family.But I live in the West and we've got plenty of raptors, so squirrels aren't a problem.  House finches enjoy the feeder as do scrub jays, junkos and the occasional sparrow.  I expect the grosbeaks will mob it when they show up a little later this year.  In the East, cardinals will be attracted if you can solve the squirrel problem. Small birds can get inside, but larger birds can easily hang onto the wire mesh. It also takes the pressure off of feeders with smaller seeds, meaning the little birds also have a fair shot at a meal.So it's a little messy, but it's a neat idea for a feeder."

Only con is when you load it with the small black sunflower seeds, you will lose a few as they will fly out the sides etc - but will catch more than it loses, so no biggie.

Also this feeder is not rain friendly.

Regular small-grain birdfeed will be too small and just pour through the holes.Secondly, as the birds eat, lots of little bits of the feed (sunflower seed shells in my case) will fall down, so try to hang this above an area where you don't mind the mess. (I first had it on our patio, then moved it so it hangs above an area where plants and flowers grow so the little bits of food just hit the soil instead of junk up the patio).As long as you're aware of these two facts, this bird feeder should work well for you. We have several birds who visit it regularly, and it's a lot of fun to see them sit inside the little &#34;tunnels&#34; and pick at the food."

From that point on, it has been the most popular feeder in our backyard, All types of birds visit - from chickadees and other clinging birds to the occasional cardinal and blue jay. The clinging type birds seem to love being able to chose where to eat - inside or out. If inside, they seem to enjoy being able to pick seeds from all the sides as well as top and bottom. It creates a &#34;room&#34; of sunflower seeds that seems to really enamor some of the birds. The cardinals will go inside the square hole and then eat inside or reach outside while sitting on the sill and having a leisurely dinner while being protected.The feeder is sturdy enough to hold up to starling and grackle abuse when they came through, unlike my other feeders. This one is tough and seems decently constructed. I have not found any problems with wires sticking out or sharp edges and no birds have had any problems with the holes or getting caught.This feeder has been a real joy to watch. It is very rare to see the feeder with no birds on it. Usually there is between 4-6 at a time and they have made for some comical entertainment at times. We use black oil sunflower seeds in this feeder and have not seen any real waste. Some does fall through but those are found by the ground seed eaters, so nothing really goes to waste.We are very pleased with this feeder!"

It's all metal construction (except for the little plastic slide lock on the upper cable, which holds down the lid) seems decent.  It attract birds well, the smaller ones get inside easily, and it's entertaining to watch.I have a few reservations . . . .  This feeder has no perch or tray.  Birds feed from it by hanging onto the wire mesh and picking the seeds out through the mesh.  Appears difficult, and the larger birds, like cardinals, which often prefer the larger seeds (I'll get to the sunflower seed part), will not fit inside and seem to be ill-adapted to hanging off the sides.  Due to the wire mesh sides, typical small bird seed mix will leak right through the sides.  The label recommends peanuts or sunflower seeds (shelled peanuts??).  When filling, even the sunflower seeds leak quite a bit -- so, a bit messy, and not economical -- but then when hung, the birds have much difficulty digging out seed through the mesh.  It's a whole lot of work for them.The squirrels haven't seemed to have caught on yet, but they will.  When they do . . . the wire mesh sides are ready made for leaping/climbing squirrels, and I suspect over time they may wreck this thing.  (I'll update if that prediction becomes reality).I've only got one other feeder.  It has a plastic dome, tray, perch, confounds squirrels and has lasted for years.  Again, this new Perky-Pet Fly-Through thing looks great . . . but in practice, it doesn't hold a candle to my old cheap plastic reliable.UPDATE after several weeks of use:  No squirrel problems, which I credit to my locating it up under our roof overhang (inaccessible to squirrels).  However, the poor birds have great difficultly coaxing the seed out of this thing.  They have tried but mostly given up.  I give it a few hard shakes occasionally which causes some seeds to fall out onto the patio below.  On behalf of the birds, I've lowered my rating from 3 stars to 2 stars."

Whether inside or outside, they eat by pulling the seeds through the mesh.  Because of the design, it will only work for sunflower seeds or shelled peanuts.  We haven't tried the peanuts.  Compared to other style feeders, I think a bit more seed ends up on the ground, which is not entirely bad, and some species prefer to feed on the ground.  It is pretty easy to use, as the top lifts up easily for filling.  You just press a button which releases it from the hanging cable and lets it slide up.  All in all, not a bad feeder, and it is fun to watch the birds use it.  I took away a star because the feeder is less versatile than those which use a regular seed mix."

The birds that are attracted to and enjoy sunflower seeds are cardinals, grosbeaks, chickadees and sparrows. Cardinals and grosbeaks will not feed off of this feeder unless they are desperate; they want tray feeders.When this is filled with sunflower seeds, the bottom holes are so large that you lose a great amount of the seeds dropping on the ground.The fly through holes can catch the birds and make it difficult for them to get out. I watched one fat chickadee struggle and hurt itself when several grackles approached. The last I saw of the poor chickadee was it hopping and dragging a wing across the snow on our deck. That was also the last time this feeder was used.Between the holes that drop the sunflower seeds and the damage to birds- this is not a feeder for the birds."

Perky-Pet needs to redesign this so it won't be dangerous to wildlife. In the meantime, it will look nice on my patio as soon as the weather warms up."

        "text": "My tree cutting activities are limited to my weekend trimming around the yard, but I want to trim limbs between 1 and 4 inches in diameter, so I graduated past the hand-held saw.  My experience started with aBlack and Decker LPP120 Cordless Pole Saw, which is basically an electric chain saw on a stick.  An awesome product, btw, but wanting on occasion to ditch the \"stick,\" I bought theBlack and Decker LCS120 Cordless Chain Saw.  For the price, I think the B&D; chain saw is good, but it's not in the same league as this GreenWorks model.  IMO, the B&D; is definitely geared for people like me that do light trimming and nothing too thick.  For a tree trunk of any decent thickness, I think that you'd want something like this model.Overall, I'm really pleased with this chain saw.  I was skeptical at first about it being a good value, given the list (and current) price of $300.  I was very fortunate to be able to try this for free on the Vine program, but $300 is a lot of money, and I kind of expected to be disappointed in the overall value.  I am not!  It is, so far, much better than the B&D.;  For full disclosure, I haven't used this extensively, yet, but I have tried it out.  I do plan to do some more trimming over the next month as we move into the holidays, and I'll update this review if my opinion changes.Do I think it's worth the money?  Yes.  I'm not a chain saw expert, though, so I'll just try to help you by describing the advantages over the less expensive B&D; LCS120.  In other words, what do you get for that extra $170?(*) More cutting length:  this might not matter to you if you just do trimming(*) Better build quality (from what I can tell so far): the B&D; isn't bad...this is just better(*) Easier and faster chain tension adjustment:  this has a knob on the side, whereas the B&D; requires you to use the included small screwdriver to turn a small dial that is located at the base of the chain.  It's not a huge deal, but I love it.  I find myself checking and adjusting the chain more than once in a session, and it was just inconvenient to have to go through the process with the B&D.;  This model makes it so easy(*) Chain brake on the hand guard:  the B&D; does not have one.  I don't actually know how important this is, but it seems like a good safety feature if the saw kicks backs(*) Better battery location:  my B&D; just gushed oil when I filled the reservoir, and it leaked all over where the battery connects.  This battery slides down on the top and isn't in danger of that happening(*) Flat bottom surface:  so you can set it down more easily without trying to balance it.  The B&D; will tend to fall onto its side for me, but this one sits down so easilyIt is heavier than the B&D;, but really not bad, and I think it's well balanced and helps a lot with the weight.  I initially thought it would be a bigger deal than it turned out to be for me.  However, if you are looking for something very lightweight, the B&D; is definitely one to look into.On a related note, I also own a GreenWorks dethather that I bought last year.  It has held up quite well over multiple uses.  I only mention it as some more info on the brand, and that I've been happy with my experience with their products."

Or a better way of putting it Adapt And Overcome!!Most of the reviewers on Amazon have used this saw for small jobs such as finish work on fire kindling and what not.My first job for this saw was cutting down a wall in a house. Don't ask why, just know it needed to be done, and I had a short time to get it done, as in hey this wall has to be history in two hours or less. It bit through everything that was in its path. Triple layer two by fours with nails (yeah I know), plaster (that was something), sheetrock, and some aluminum. It took some time but the task was finished , and no animals were harmed during completion of this project.I then on the same charge went on to chew down a tree as big around as a hub cap. That was ugly and I was a sweat ball covered in tree guts before it came down. The saw battery was spent. I was spent. The saw had used up all of the bar chain oil in the full reservoir, and came out of the day undamaged.I have also used it for more suitable limbs, branches, and a slew of treated 4 x 4 fence posts with impressive results.Needless to say always use eye protection and gloves, and I don't recommend abusing this fine saw like I did, just know that if forced to, you can and both you and saw will live through it.The only downside I found was that extra or replacement batteries are pretty pricey.Very Highly Recommended"

        "text": "Bottom line: There's a lot to like about this chain saw with regard to build quality, features and performance. However, it is equaled on all these metrics by a good corded model for a lot less. The convenience of cordless may not be worth the extra cost.Full review: Like many homeowners with a suburban-sized yard, a gas-powered chainsaw is overkill. It comes in handy when you need it, but it's unlikely to see much use during the year. That complicates maintenance, since gas equipment does not like to sit idle unless it has been properly prepped to do so.The alternative has typically been a corded electric chainsaw. A good quality electric will give you much of the performance of a gas model without any of the gas engine maintenance issues. But, you're tied to an outlet or a generator.This chainsaw takes it a step further, and is the first cordless chainsaw that is a \"real\" chainsaw. Up until now, the cordless models have been limited use tools, such as the line made by Black and Decker. I have three different B&D; cordless chainsaws and they work well, but are limited to branch trimming. I think of them as pruners more so than chainsaws.The power this puts out is simply amazing, and equals that of my favorite electric chain saw, the WORX WG300 (WORX WG300 14-Inch 3 HP 14 Amp Electric Chain Saw).The saw includes a number of great design features to make it easier and safer to use. These include an automatic bar oiling system with an easy to see oil level window, a blade brake (an essential safety feature), metal dogs (spikes) at the base of the bar to reduce kickback, and a 16 inch bar that will give you the ability to tackle a pretty formidable tree. It is easy to adjust the chain tension, and it actually comes with a very good manual (a rarity these days). The 40v battery is massive compared with the 18v models I'm used to, and gives the saw ample power.The build quality seems excellent. This has a lot of heft, but it feels well-balanced. I didn't have any problems controlling the saw in use. You do notice the weight, but no more so than a good electric, and it is lighter than a similarly-sized gas machine.It includes a nice quality carry case that has an extension to fit the bar. It works well for keeping the saw clean while it is stored in the garage. The case fits just the saw (with or without a battery installed). It would have been nice if the case were a bit larger so the charger could fit in there as well.Blade speed was more than enough to make quick work of some 10 inch diameter logs. Again, a good gas powered saw, such as a Stihl, would leave this in the dust, but unless you're felling trees for a living, a bit slower blade speed is not a problem.The problem I had was the same as with any cordless device - run time. The manufacturer claims a charge will let you go through a cord of wood. I can't say if that is accurate, but I did start having run time problems once I had been using it for about 20 minutes. You can get through a lot of wood in 20 minutes with this, but the run time is not enough for me to get through what I need it to do on a single battery. As with any other cordless device, the solution is to have 2 batteries, so one is in the charger at all times. But that adds even more cost to an already pricy tool.The other issue I had was that it takes a second or so to come up to speed. Not a big issue, but enough to be noticeable. Lastly, while the handle is OK in terms of comfort, it does not excel in that area. It needs a rounder trigger handle, and the cross bar should have some non-slip padding on it for comfort and security. Collectively, these issues drop the rating to 4 stars.So, would I recommend this? Yes, but with the caveat that you can get the same performance and features in a corded electric at about a third of the price. While freedom from a cord is worth something, I'm not sure it's worth the premium price of this model. It is worth considering, however, due to its performance and ease of use."

Well \"real\" just went green. When I first used this saw I went from a 4\" branch to a 6\" to a 12+\" log and I was blown away by the power of this saw. Hot knife meet butter. And this was dead wood I was cutting thru, that is the worst on a chainsaw.The pros to this saw are;Push button start: Anyone familiar with chainsaws is also familiar with wearing yourself out just pulling the cord and trying to get it to start. Also it turns itself off if it sits too long or if the chain gets caught.Running time is easily equal to a full tank of gas in a regular chainsaw and since there is no gas, the bar & chain oil reservoir is larger, so no running out in the middle of a job. Also since there is no gas, it can sit for months without the gas going bad and gumming up the carburetor.Recharge time is fast, especially for a 40V battery.One major con is that when you run out of gas, you just refill the tank and go back to work, but with a battery powered tool, you have to recharge the battery. I wish the companies that make these tools would realize they need to come with two batteries. One to use while the other recharges.One minor con, Ice Storms! I have used my chainsaws more to clean up after ice storms than for any other reason and often there is no electricity to recharge a tool like this. Another reason more than one battery is a good idea.Overall, this is a magnificent tool! It is great for a homeowner who only needs a chainsaw every once in a while.

This cordless saw is equivalent to my Poulan Pro which I will probably never use again. I especially like this saw because it is quiet. I live in a ranch community and people are living here to get away from noise. This saw allows me to collect fire wood in places where I would othewise be disturbing the tranquility of the community. I am stunned at the battery life, and how quickly it can be recharged. By the time the battery runs down, I am run down as well. The other thing I like are the safety features. The saw is light and easy to handle and this really helps reduce stress. The chain brake works well. The other thing I really like is the ability to adjust the chain without needing tools. Just make sure you check the tightness periodically. I put a couple of drops of blue Loctite on the threads to help keep the hand tightened bar retainer from loosening. I cut through some huge 24 inch white oak today. Normally, this would be a job for my Rancher 460. While it took considerably longer with the Greenworks, it was much more pleasant and I was free from noxious exhaust and forest raping noise. I will follow up with an update after a month or so of use.Update: I use this saw routinely since initial purchase and especially during the winter months in NC. My house is at 4k feet in the Great Smokies in NC. It is heated with an outdoor wood boiler. I feed my furnace with the plentiful seasoned dead fall which litters my property and ranch community.  On a single charge, this saw will fill the bed of my Tacoma shortbed truck. I use the saw several times per week and it has never failed me. Rarely do I ever use my gas saws anymore except for really big stuff. I bought an extra battery for the saw but rarely use it. My back runs down before the saw battery. My neighbors never hear me cutting, and I can cut in areas where I might otherwise be disturbing somebody. Even if it fails on me...I will immediately purchase another because it makes cutting so much more pleasant and safe. Tip: I spray the chain with DuPont Chain Saver....my chains stay sharp even when I am cutting soiled dead fall. This Teflon product is simply amazing for this purpose."

This saw is much quitter than the Stihl, much easier to start, and cuts almost as well.  One charged battery goes a long way, and with a second battery in the charger I'll wear out before the batteries.  Just for fun I tried cutting a 14\" felled tree into pieces. Not a problem.I like everything about this saw.

        "text": "GreenWorks G-MAX 40V 16-inch DigiPro Brushless ChainsawNot being a chain saw aficionado, I will probably offend those of you who use a chain saw daily.  I use a chain saw infrequently.  Normally no more often than twice a year unless we have had stormy weather and if it is really stormy and I lose six trees simultaneously (3 years ago) then I call my tree guy.I do not use a chain saw on a ladder. If I can't have two feet on the ground I don't use it.  Now that I have established my credentials, I like this little saw.  It is very well made.  It is replacing an equally small electric chain saw.  I don't intend to fell forests with it, but when the occasional tree does come down, this appears that it will be able to handle it.  With that said, I am not planning on cutting down one of my trees to merely test it.  It came with very good instructions, a charger and a battery.I called the 800 number to verify that there truly is a human being answering the phone and fielding questions.  I asked if I needed to buy expensive bar and chain lubricant and I was assured a good quality, NEW not used, 10w-30 would work just fine.For some reason it runs even quieter than my electric chain saw.  It has a nice tension knob that should be a feature on my electric chain saw but isn't.  Screw driver and two wrenches were needed to change the tension on my old saw.  This has a handy dandy little knob to adjust the tension.Overall without felling a tree, it cuts better than the old electric chain saw (perhaps the brand new chain could be a factor there), it is quieter and much more user friendly. (the tension knob)  In addition, I was able to get technical support immediately and she was friendly and informative.  As far as I am concerned good customer service should weigh heavily on any purchasing decision.This appears it will give me good service and with a lithium battery, it should give me good life.  The battery and charger are warranted for two years and the saw is warranted for four.  That is hard to beat.Update: March 18,2014, after having been away from home for 2.5 months, I came home to much tree damage.  I had totally forgotten that I had this unit and was thinking I still had my electric chain saw (given away).  When I went in to get the chain saw I saw the battery and immediately assumed that it would be necessary to charge it as it hadn't been charged or used since I first wrote the review, 5 months ago.  Imagine my surprise when it fired right up, cut through branches up to 10\" in diameter as if they were butter.  The convenience of the battery, the lack of a cord and the hassle of a gas engine makes this my new favorite tool."

        "text": "I can see why this saw gets mostly five star reviews.  It is, indeed, as powerful as a gas saw, and much more powerful than my previous plug-in electric saw.  Plus, you will be tired of cutting before the battery runs out.  This saw is easily controlled and cuts fast -- really fast.  The weight is just right, too.  If you use a chainsaw, you won't go wrong with this one."

        "text": "This is a wonderful multiuse tool that both sucks and blows! Yep, it will suck up your leaves and carefully place them into a bag that you can empty into your mulch box (You do have one don't you?). Of course, you may be one of those who simply mow your leaves back into your lawn. It will also blow those grass clippings off of your driveway back into the lawn.Do I sound like one of those \"green\" people? Actually, our community has an ordinance prohibiting green waste from going into our landfill, so this was a lifesaver for me.The best parts:It is battery operated. I do NOT do gas powered items - sorry, they intimidate me. And, while I don't mind cords, my husband hates them, so the only way for both of us to enjoy this is the mere fact that it IS battery operated.It is \"relatively\" light. It weighs in at about 6 pounds. While I would prefer to have it lighter (I would prefer to have EVERYTHING lighter) WORX runs over 8 pounds, and Toro is 10 pounds for their blower/vacs.It is GreenWorks. I have been using other garden products of theirs for some time and have grown to appreciate the way that they have lasted for me.It is easy to use.The things that are concerns:This comes with a single battery. Replacement batteries run more than $100. Hopefully the battery lasts a long time, but if you need to use this on high for a period of time OR you have a large yard, this may not be the right one for you. On lower settings, I can use this for about an hour.This is my first blower OR vac, so I have little to compare it to, but I really do appreciate it in our 1/3 of an acre yard with 4 large trees and one small fruit tree."

        "text": "Gas-powered leafblowers are powerful, but they're incredibly loud, they spew out a surprising amount of fumes, you have to keep a can of gas-oil mix just for the blower, and engine maintenance is a hassle.  So years ago I switched to a Toro electric blower, which is zero maintenance; but dealing with a 100' cord is a real hassle.  So, when I saw this GreenWorks battery-powered leafblower, I had high hopes, especially since I've been very happy with my GreenWorks G-MAX lawnmower.The blower is great for weekly cleanup.  It's lighter than I expected and produces a very strong air stream -- at least as powerful as my Toro AC powered blower that has the same MPH rating.  The speed control can be easily dialed up and down with your thumb while using the tool, so you can continuously adjust the blower to get just the right force.  Very convenient and easy to use.  I find myself using this blower ten times more often than my old blower, simply because its so simple and convenient.  It takes three seconds (literally) to grab a battery off the shelf, snap it into the blower, and get to work.The only downside of the blower (which almost caused me to drop the rating down to four stars) is that the battery only lasts about 15-20 minutes.  My GreenWorks G-MAX lawn mower runs twice as long on a single battery, so I was expecting better battery life.  The 15-20 minute run time is fine for weekly cleanups, but it means this leafblower won't be able to replace my other leafblower for fall cleanup, when I typically have to run the blower for over an hour to move mountains of fallen leaves.Bottom line:  I really like this blower for weekly cleanup.  It's lightweight, powerful, and super convenient.  It starts instantly and creates no fumes, so I tend to use it a lot more often.  It won't do hour-long leaf clearing sessions in the fall, but it's a great yard tool, especially if you own other GreenWorks G-MAX tools, since the batteries are fully interchangeable.  (Buying into the GreenWorks system of 40V G-MAX lawn tools is sort of like buying into Dewalt 18V tools.  The convenience of interchangeable batteries is huge.  I own three different GreenWorks tools and have become a huge fan of their system.)"

I'm only 5'4 and about 110 pounds but found this wasn't too heavy to use. It was so easy to put together (but one thing I'd recommend to manufacture is to label the parts to the vacuum - that was the only thing that tripped me up a bit). I've never ever used any machine to pick up leaves (just a good old fashion rake!)- so I can't really compare this to anything. I was attracted to this seriously because of it's color and what appeared to be its simplicity. The charge seems to hold and the bag is easy to throw over my shoulder and then empty. I love this and would highly recommend it - with something this simple AND good looking, it might inspire more women like me (a girly girl!) to pick it up, get outside, and do some work! Though I recommend if your wife does do that, it might be nice for you to whip up a great dinner for her!"

It also didn't work too well when the leaves were wet. It was okay on dry leaves, but where there was heavy coverage, I had to go over areas a few times, but if the leaves were wet it was much less effective. I loved not having to fool around with a cord, but I just didn't find it powerful enough for bigger jobs.It's really nice to have and easier to set up and use to do the front and back porch, front walkway, but not for major heavy leaf blowing. I did notice that other reviews found it plenty powerful, so I'm wondering if maybe it is the unit I received? I can't say for sure, but based on the unit I've been using, it isn't enough for me to give away our corded blower."

        "text": "Update 12/13/13 - After using the vacuum portion for awhile to vacuum up fall leaves, one annoyance has become obvious - when you go to attach the vacuum tube to the bottom, it is very awkward to try to balance it and slide it into the slot and lock it into place.  Seems like it should be so easy, but it always takes me multiple tries and fumbling with it and sometimes when I think I've got it, then I pick it up and knock the tube on any little thing and it falls off again.  This process is very frustrating and makes me dread having to use it as vacuum.  Everything else about this blower/vac is fantastic, but that one small thing really ruins the fun and ease of using this.  Battery life continues to impress, as I haven't yet run it all the way down before completing a job.This blower vac is nice and powerful, when used at the top setting - the lower settings are not very useful as it doesn't blow hard enough at the lower settings to really accomplish much. I confess I didn't immediately see the red button that puts it into high gear, but once you push it, look out - this blower really goes to town. On max settings this blower seems to easily put out as much power as a gas powered blower - definitely more powerful than any other battery operated blower that I've tried.This blower is definitely way more powerful than my Worx 18volt li-ion cordless blower, however, it is also quite a bit larger which makes it a little less comfortable to blow grass clippings off after mowing, however I'd say the bulkier size is definitely worth it for the increased power you get.  The size/weight of this is comparable to my corded Toro vac/blower, and it performs as strongly or better than it, but you get the bonus of no power cord.The battery on this lasts about on average to other blowers, since all blowers seem to run down the batteries quickly - I was able to blow and vacuum up all my grass clippings without running the battery down, while with the Worx blower and I would have to switch batteries half way thru. So far, I have been easily able to do all by blowing/vacuuming on one charge.  If you really want to stretch the battery run time out, you can run it at a lower setting or not in high mode.I also like how easy it is to convert from blower to vac - attach the tube to the bottom and lock it in and replace the blower tube with the bag and you're ready to go.  I use this weekly for the yard, since i mulch mow - i use it as a blower to blow all the grass clippings and leaves into a pile and then switch it to vac mode to suck up the leaves and clippings to use as mulch elsewhere.  I can't wait till fall finally comes to Texas and I can try it out on all the leaves that will get dropped in the yard.As for price, I think that if you really want the power of a gas blower or corded, then this is absolutely worth every penny.  If you don't necessarily need max power and maybe only want to do light blowing of leaves or grass clippings, then maybe the cheaper non digipro version of this might be a better fit."

Since I already have a GMax Lawnmower with Batteries I opted for this. The Vacuum is okay, but will struggle to pick up wet heavy leaves (as expected). The blower is excellent - better than my black and decker blower. However, this unit is a bit on the heavy side, and with my long uphill driveway it can be a bit tedious, but it works well nonetheless."

The battery doesn't bleed dry during the week, so I know it's ready to go.  However, this blower is terrible for fall leaves.  I have several giant oaks and even with frequent cleanings in the fall, the leaves are at least a foot deep before I get to the curb.  This blower has to be used at top speed to handle that depth of leaves, and going full tilt the battery lasts half an hour max.  The yard (half acre) takes a couple of hours to do a full clean, and it looks like I will have to continue to use my Toro 51609 for that."

        "text": "The Greenworks G-Max is literally a snap to put together.  It comes with charger, 40v battery, blower tube, concentration nozzle  (doesn't help me concentrate), mulcher tubes, leaf bag,and operator's manual. I actually  found it challenging to find the printed in China manual since it's printed on brown recycled paper that blends in with the color of the packing box. It's an attractive tool, a little on the heavy side, but lighter than my Stihl gas blower and well balanced. But what about performance?For clearing our deck and sidewalks the low speed setting with the variable speed set to five is far more than adequate. To move lots of leaves and twigs kick into Turbo Speed and be amazed by the flying leaves and the power in your hands. Of course, the Stihl gas blower is more powerful, but for my purposes the power of the GreenWorks is more than adequate. So far one battery is all I've needed as long as I recharge the battery between uses. An hour and a half in the charger usually gets it back to full power. Unlike my NiCad Black and Decker battery powered tools, this one doesn't weaken towards the end of the battery life. It just suddenly dies. To monitor the power left, one must keep an eye on the power indicator on the battery. Depending on the settings used, I can work 20 to 30 minutes on one battery charge.Verdict on the blower - I like it so much that I'll rarely if ever use my Stihl gas blower. The low powered Black and Decker NiCad blower will go into retirement and the corded Toro will be used only on occasion. This tool is so good that I'll probably buy the Greenworks chainsaw next so I can use batteries on both.Greenworks G-Max also can be configured as a vac. I must disclose that I've never liked the vac function on any of my vac/blowers, but gave this one a fair shot just in case. For me the vac function is more trouble than it's worth even though it only takes a few minutes to remove the blower tube and install the mulcher tubes and the bag. The suction is fair at best and vacuuming is a tedious chore. I think I could easily fill a large leaf bag the old fashioned way faster than I could fill the bag attachment of the blower/vac.  I will say that the vacuum function is nice for getting leaves out of shrubbery or collecting leaves from between closely growing shrubbery in beds by the house.My only other complaint with this unit is the ON/OFF button, a slightly raised dimple on an electronic pad that's not as easy to use as a push button or lever control.Bottom line - I am pleasantly surprised by the performance of this Greenworks tool and like it enough to want to purchase more tools in its 40v family."

        "text": "As others have stated, it is a very good blower with plenty of power.The 40v 4AH battery lasts almost 45 minutes, depending on the power setting -- which depends on the type of leaves and condition.Two switches control on/off and hi/low, plus a variable dial for speed. Seems to me, they could have incorporated hi/low function into the speed control because having a separate hi/low switch is an extra step.At maximum power (needed for vacuuming) it only lasts 15 minutes, so I use extra battery packs from other G-Max tools I own.The suction is insufficient for some smaller/heavier leaves -- they get sucked in, but tend not to get discharged unless broader leaves are also used, even at maximum power. Also, needle-like leaves tend to get stuck underneath the sensor wire at discharge nozzle.For this reason, I would suggest getting the blower-only model if you do not need the vacuum function.FYI - I also use Toro 51609 blower/vac which is excellent! It is AC-corded, so it is pain to drag out extension cords, but it is more powerful and the work can be done in about third of the time compared to this GreenWorks DigiPro. I use the DigiPro cordless when it is too far from the outlet, though.The charger is disappointing. It wastes power even when not charging and they say to unplug it when not in use. It is a pain when several chargers are used. Two LEDs indicate power and charging status. There is a label wrapped around the plug that explain how to interpret the LED color and blinking status. This could have been better handled if they printed the marking next to the actual LED or just added a couple of LEDs."

        "text": "As you can see from the original review, I had my reservations but overall, Greenworks has a decent product.  As it turns out, the weak battery life ended up being a DEAD battery after less than 6 months.  Greenworks customer service was contacted with no mention of Vine participation.  They handled the issue very quickly and professionally, exceeding my expectations (some other reviews report less than satisfactory experiences)  After trying the new battery, I can say that it performs better than the prior one, but still goes to 2 bars within about ~15 minutes.Original review from October 2013 below....I have a Black and Decker corded electric blower/vac, and it's supposedly rated at 225 mph.  This, at 185 mph seems every bit as powerful.  The aur speed is like the PSI on a pressure washer - it can be a little misleading.  If you get a large amount of air at 185 mph, it can be more functional than a small stream of air at 225 mph.It's a little heavier than my corded blower, but the convenience far outweighs this.1) There's an odd little nozzle extension that I decided I didn't need - this also gives the blower a larger exhaust.2) Using the extra power mode eats your battery pretty darn quick. My guess is that it will last less than 15 minutes on the high setting.  That should be enough for most jobs, however.3) Charger is annoying - you have to push hard to get it to click in, then removing it is also very tricky since you have tu simultaneously release the latch which is now upside down, and pull away from you.  My wife was unable to do this after several tries.4) On/off and high/low switches are really low cost \"membrane\" switches - very small and hard to use with gloves.  I also don't know how well they will hold up over time.  They really should have gone with something bigger and more robust."

So I decided to try and fit both my Weber and my electric smoker under it. While the base of my smoker is bulky and square like the top, the bottom of my Weber is just slim metal legs. So even with this grill cover cinching closed at the base, both my grill and my smoker are able to fit inside it together, as it's the bottom that's shaped more narrowly than the top.It's much softer than I expected it to be. Other grill covers I've had have been a more tarp like material. This is softer, like fabric, and drapes around the contours of the grill underneath it. The cover has sewn on handles and vent flaps on either side, and even a large pocket for keeping thing like dripping utensils.I really like the light color of this cover. It matches the siding of my house, and has a cleaner look to it than the black covers I've had in the past. The brown color blocking at the base is nice since it keeps in mind that this section of the cover would be the most likely to rub/drag against the ground, porch, garage floor, etc. Since it's the most likely section to get dirty, being dark brown helps hide what dirt might get on it.I'll be very interested to see how well this cover holds up to our brutal northern Minnesota winters. Where sub zero temperatures and non-stop snowstorms last many months every year. During these snowstorms the winds are relentless. Last year an wrought iron bistro table I had on my porch was picked up and flipped, causing the glass on the top to shatter. So I will be eager to see how well this grill cover helps protects my Weber and smoker in the coming months.

If you have a medium-sized or smaller grill, you could possibly use the remaining space as a tent-style dog house, or for summertime guests.The only (very minor) nit I will pick is that the elastic bottom makes it a bit more of a struggle to get the cover fitted over the top of the grill. My old cover had parallel, non-elastic sides and it slipped easily down over the grill, using Velcro straps to cinch the sides tight so it wouldn't blow off. This cover is definitely not going to blow off, but getting it on the grill is a bit annoying and it doesn't have quite as neat of an appearance. Then again, I don't have to remember to fasten the Velcro straps like on my old cover - once this baby is in place, you're done.Definitely recommended for the price."

It's been below freezing here, but not the temps we normally get around the first of February, so I have yet to see if this is a fact, but I have no doubts it will do fine as my other one is not nearly as sturdy and has gone through 5 winters so far.The design is nice and will go with my modern patio area very nicely. I have a concrete wall on each side and the color will blend in very well. I like the wavy texture on the barrel, very modern and very now.The two spigots levels are great and I'll probably never use the higher one.Holds 50 gallons, that's a lot of watering if you have a small yard or a few potted plants.WHAT I DON'T LIKE:The top design is really odd in my opinion. You would never be able to really put a real plant in this tub design as it would get washed out, especially if you have a large roof with a lot of watershed. I fill up my other 50 gal. bucket in one short rain storm, so I know this is not going to be a place for real plants to hang out. Probably will get a fake one and simply weight it down in there.I don't like the allowance for a hook-up to the downspout. This should be universal and allow for the spout to go directly into the top loosely instead of resting on top of the screen.  The screen situation is nice, but sort of unnecessary in my book, I don't get that much stuff in the gutter. Now, that said, since this would be nearly impossible to clean out (why is there no removable top on this design?) I can see why they want a screen screwed in place.Given the amount of rain we've had, mine is full already but was somewhat problematic to hook up.Great design look, poor design functionality.  Form follows function, so perhaps this design should go back for a re-work."

And the planter area doesn't seem the best either. My Agreen barrel has a planter with lots of tiny drainage holes. This one has just one small hole sort of on the side, not the bottom. I drilled several other ones in the bottom of the planter with a small bit. The idea is you want the plants watered, but not floating and the water to pass through into the barrel but as little soil sediment as possible to get in or you will have to take everything apart and clean it out so the spigot isn't clogged. Even then I think a shallow bed of shale before putting in your soil and plants isn't a bad idea. And cleaning the barrel out looks like it might be tricky as it doesn't have a lid but just the small meshed area for water collection."

I admit I haven't tried anything there yet - if something works I will amend this review.  I have left it open but worry about mosquitoes breeding there - it's a bit deep to function as a bird bath - about 4 1/2 inches.I like the looks of the rain barrel - better than my green plastic one  - it doesn't look like cheap plastic to me, could be cement from a distance.  I like having one spigot up high - much easier to reach for filling a watering can.  It was easy to install too (for my handyman!).Update after two months:  the resevoir on top has turned out to be a breeding ground for mosquito larvae.  I would prefer a barrel where water did not collect on top.  It also collects dirt."

        "text": "Good Ideas Palm Rain Barrel is a good idea for most any home. It helps collect rain water which can then be used for other household purposes, helping to save money and conserve resources.I have used other rain barrels but this is the first one I have owned that is solid in construction. In fact, if I have to name one aspect of this rain barrel I like best, it would be the solid, sturdy design. It seems like it can stand up to the elements and withstand any type of inclement weather. Lucky for me, it doesn&#8217;t snow where I live but the durable design is good for those who live in harsher climates.With its attractive, neutral design, this rain barrel matches up well with most outdoor d&eacute;cor and I like that it has two spigots for convenience. There is also the ability to place a plant on top, as you can see in the picture. I haven&#8217;t done this and, given how shallow the space on top is, I don&#8217;t know if placing a plant here is really a good idea. If it was deeper, perhaps so, but it&#8217;s so shallow that most plants won&#8217;t fare very well.The things that bother me a little with this rain barrel are its lack of a removable top and issues with installation. There is a screen on top to help prevent debris and bugs from getting inside. And it&#8217;s a good thing the rain barrel has this because there is no way to open the top for cleaning. The best you could do is remove the small screen and try to find something narrow to stick through the small opening for cleaning. The screen will keep out leaves and other things, but if the barrel gets smelly and needs an interior cleaning job, there is little you can do.With the installation, I did have some small issues and concerns. You need to place this rain barrel directly under a downspout and because it is so tall, that will likely mean removing a large section of your downspout in order to fit the rain barrel underneath. Depending on your particular downspout design, it could be a problem and you may have to cut off a portion of the spout to get it situated just right. Then, there could be issues with the spigots. They provide tape to help form a good seal, but only time will tell if the seal holds up and the water doesn&#8217;t leak.Overall, however, I like the Good Ideas Palm Rain Barrel and recommend it for most homes. It helps conserve water, performs adequately, and looks nice in my backyard. It could stand for some improvements, but it is still a good device for water conservation."

I don't really see trying to use the top for a planter unless I use plants that are potted and have a saucer underneath.I haven't needed the &#34;Built-In Overflow Management System&#34; yet and I doubt that I'll use both spigots at the same time. However, having an upper one means I don't have to bend over very far when I just want to fill a watering can, and the lower one is best for watering with a hose (more pressure plus the barrel will furnish water even if only a quarter of the way full).The hardware appears to be well made. If this is your first rain barrel, consider placing it convenient to plants that are not easily reached by an existing spigot. Convenience means that you are less likely to neglect watering your plants. And if you are in a climate that gets low temperatures, don't forget to drain your barrel as winter approaches. It's best to drain it and then store it someplace where it's sheltered from extreme cold.The water that comes off your roof and through your gutters is not completely clean but it is good enough for plants. Many homeowners will find this to be a worthwhile investment."

It has brass fitting and has very nice looking body.If you get low rain fall amounts this is a very cute barrel.I live in the mid west and we get huge rain down pours, this barrel has no way to direct over flow. It fills and runs along a small track to pour off the front. I have other rain barrels that I can daisy chain together , this one has two drains, one down low and one half way up, it won't work for over flow unless I have it set higher than the other barrels. Since I don't want water to run over next to my foundation I chose to install this barrel below a gutter on a shed away from the house. So if you live some where with low rain fall amounts or have a small gutter on a covered deck or the like, this is a very nice looking rain barrel with good fittings. If you can get large amounts of rain in a short time and have foundation issues or don't want to go out and flip a diverter switch in the middle of a rain storm, you might want to look for a larger barrel or better over flow system."

        "text": "We live in an area with exceptionally high water bills and ample rain so water barrels are a 'no brainer'. Unfortunately, living in the suburbs also means appearance matters almost (maybe more than) function. In the past, we've purchased the Algreen rain barrels that look like big terra cotta jugs and have been happy with them more or less (B0013CJLI6 ATIN number). However, one one can never have too many rain barrels so when this came up for review, I jumped at the opportunity.PackagingThis arrived promptly and well packaged without any dings or dents. My original Algreen order had a big dent which I managed to get 'unkinked&#34; but suffice to say, this held up better. It is a big box and very cumbersome so keep this in mind especially if mobility or other related considerations are an issue.Quality of ConstructionI'd have to rate the quality of construction 'excellent'. It is molded but very thick...much more so than the Algreen 50 gal rain barrels. The planter does not have drainage which is a bit odd. The screen is thick and built-in so more stable. There is a breathing hole and two well placed spigots made out of brass. You will need to install the spigots (2 of them...tape is included to form a tight seal). These are attractive and made out of metal which looks better than the plastic but only time will tell if they hold up to rust/corrosion. There is a notable seam and for some reason, one of the spigot holes is placed adjacent to the seam making it difficult to position when attempting to hide the seam. Compared to the Algreen 50 gal barrels, this feels more substantial and of an overall better quality. Note, it does not come with a drainage hose so plan accordingly.AppearanceThis is an attractive, very neutral color, rain barrel. The picture doesn't show it as well but the entire outside is covered in a type of 'wave' pattern which I think will likely collect dirt more readily than a flat/smooth surface. The lighter color is also more likely to show it than the terra cotta Algreen barrel. All in all, this is attractive but not as attractive as the Algreen. However, it will be easy to wash off and appearance is truly in the eye of the beholder.StabilityAs you can see from the product photo, the bottom is smaller than the top although not by a lot. We set this up on a few paver/walking stones for added stability...more than ample. This is VERY heavy when filled with water so taking the time to reinforce it before allowing it to be filled is prudent.What You Will Need- Stable place for placement. When filled with water this will weigh well over 400 lbs so shifting sand/other could become a problem. We use a couple of large walking stones/pavers for support which is more than ample.- Hose. This does not come with a hose. We use remnants purchased here on Amazon.- Downspout drainage. This is designed for use with a downspout which fits over the built-in (but removable) grill screen."

The planter portion is about 8&#34; deep and is somewhat wide, you can easily get a flat of flowers in.The aesthetics however is where the beauty of this barrel ends. Unlike the Fiskars, which has a diverter to hook up to your downspout, this just has a screened inlet. There is no mechanism to attach this barrel to a downspout. The instructions tell you how to, but there is nothing to do so. Further, with the included instructions and screened method, there is nothing to stop this barrel from overflowing once the top has been reached by the water. There are also holes in the planter portion, which means the soil is going to be a soggy mess all the time unless you close those holes. This is because the inlet and top level of the barrel is above the depth of the planter. If you were to use the planter, I would recommend either a fake plant, or plugging the holes entirely.It is nice that the barrel comes with decent hardware for the lower and upper spigot."

This is an almost perfect barrel for my purposes.Having already used rain barrels, I see two signficant improvements in this new barrel.  First, I like that the area on top of the barrel has a hole to keep the depression where you could have a plant from filling and holding water.  In my old rain barrel, this depression became a serious area for mosquito breeding, but in my new barrel the area will stay dry and mosquitos will have to move along.Also, I like the fact that there are two spigots, one near the top of the barrel, one near the bottom, and increasing the ease with which I can get water out of the barrel.So what&#8217;s with my judgement of &#8216;almost perfect?&#8217;  I do not care for the look of the barrel.  It is called Sandstone, but rather than the pink to red color of real sandstone, this barrel is an unappealing gray.  Patterned after the bark of a palm tree, it does nothing to enhance the look of my yard. In spite of this, I&#8217;ll use this barrel to collect rain water and keep my plants from dying in the ongoing drought.Overall, this is a good barrel which will hold 50 gallons of water and keep things moist during the worst of summer heat.  I am happy to recommend it to gardeners and preppers.Four Stars!"

        "text": "Like other reviewers I wavered between awarding this product three or four stars. I eventually settled on four stars because of the easy installation, nice included hardware, and the striking aesthetics, but I'm still on the fence. This rain barrel is not without its flaws and quirks though.  As a frame of reference, I have a Fiskar's rain barrel, two barrels made by the county out of large, converted soda syrup containers, and one homemade contraption converted by  me from a large trash can.The Good Ideas barrel is relatively light and easy to install. I like that it comes with two brass spigots that screw into two pre-threaded holes.  To install the barrel I elevated it on cinder blocks to improve water flow. I also removed a segment of  drain spout and replaced it with a piece of flexible, plastic drain. The bottom end of the plastic drain piece rests firmly atop the rain barrel so that water falls into the barrel through the piece of included screening.An alternate way to install the barrel is to use a diverter like the one I installed for my Fiskars barrel. Installation requires cutting the downspout, but the inverter is then permanently in place. When the barrel is filled to capacity, the diverter then sends water down the bottom part of the downspout in the usual way.  A diverter can be purchased on the Good Ideas site.I don't particularly like the planter design on the top of the rain barrel. There's only one small hole for drainage to the front of the barrel. After a rain today I had to tilt the barrel forward to drain water from the plant cavity; this would be impossible with a full rain barrel. If the top plant cavity fills with too much water, it will drain down the front of the barrel perhaps discoloring it.  If you opt not to plant anything in the plant cavity, then some water will sit in it and perhaps attract mosquitoes.I'm also not crazy about the design for accommodating overflow, a channel around the perimeter of the top diverting water to the front of the barrel so that it cascades down against the barrel. I would prefer a system that lets the overflow be directed away from the barrel and away from the house.Amazon requires Vine reviews to be posted within 30 days of receiving the product. I'll need more time to satisfactorily evaluate this barrel, so may return and modify this review if circumstances warrant any changes or additions.UPDATE -  After watching the rain barrel function during and after ten inches of rain, I'm starting to warm up to it. The top cavity for plants works better than I thought it would. Some water remains after a rain, but it disappears within a day. I've even bought some potting soil to plant flowers up there.The overflow design also works better than anticipated; in fact the flow of water along the textured front is quite attractive. Also overflow doesn't puddle in front of the barrel as I feared. Some leaves collected on the front of the barrel from the gutter overflow, but these were easily brushed off later."

        "text": "Very impressed with the construction of this barrel, solid plastic and looks good.  Better than the rest of my rain barrels.Two spigots,  placed at 90 degrees away from each other (so if one is facing front, the other will be facing to the side.  The spigots were easy to install.The top has a plastic grid.  It has been my experience that these eventually crack and break.  You can replace them with (I know this sound strange) the plastic &#8220;canvas&#8221; that is sold for needlepointing.Having had rain barrels for years, I have a couple concerns about this one, which may or may not apply to your situation.Over time gunk tends to build up in them (from being washed off the roof) and they need to be rinsed out.  This is going to be difficult with this design, since the only hole is the one designed for the water to go in and it is about 4 inches in diameter.  There are screws over the mesh, so you would be able to dump it, but that is going to be harder than taking off a lid and cleaning it out.  That said, our lids often come off our other rain barrels, leading animals desperate for  a drink to a watery grave, which is not fun for either of us.I put dirt and flowers in the top indentation.  Water can run out from the top.  Good.  But when the rain barrel filled up quickly, then water started pouring into the plants, leaving them floating and dirt all down the side.  This is because there is no overflow valve, for which I am deducting a star.  They state a &#8220;built in overflow system&#8221; which is basically a channel along the top where the water goes in that directs the excess to the front where in theory it would run down the front of the barrel.  In practice, a solid rainstorm overwhelmed this system .  I have three other kind of rain barrels, and they all have places to attach a hose at the top, so that you can &#8220;daisy chain&#8221; them together or direct the excess flow with a hose to some other point.  And you cannot even add a connector to this rainbarrel, since the texture means there is no flat spot to drill a hole to attach a faucet.  I ended up drilling a hole and inserting a piece of wide flexible tubing, which dribbles but does help to direct the excess water into a second barrel.  If you have not used a rain barrel before, you will be surprised by how quickly they fill with water.The directions also say you need to drain it when temperatures are below freezing.  With my other barrels I have found that if they freeze, and are full, the lid just gets pushed off and the ice expands without cracking the barrel.  If they are only part full, the ice just expands up and it is not a problem.  I am not sure that this one, with that small hole, would withstand freezing.I waffled between three and four stars, since the overflow system is simply not well designed.  But this is solid construction and I like having two spigots so I went with four stars."

We have a remote corner of our yard that has some banana trees and a compost pile that impede the water spray from the sprinkler system. Thus, some new hedge plants were not getting water and died. Reworking the sprinklers would not be worth it because the banana trees are ever changing and so is the compost pile. I wanted to find a solution to the water problem before installing more hedge plants. There is a gutter downspout near this area so it was a snap to set up this rain barrel and give it a test run! Assembly and set up of the rain barrel was easy and quick (10 minutes to get it out of the box and get the spigots installed). Next was cutting the aluminum gutter spout (I made quick work of it with a jig saw) and pushing the barrel into position. That's it!This intelligently designed barrel has a mesh filter screen on top to keep out debri. It has a planter space with its own drain hole so as not to drown whatever you put in it. It also has an overflow \"gutter\" of its own that will direct water away from the \"planter\" in the event your barrel fills to the top and can not hold anymore water. Lastly, the attractive design looks classy and \"fits in\" to our upscale home.I am very satisfied with this product and would recommend. Thanks for reading, I hope this review is helpful!"

It&#8217;s basically a plastic container with a battery-powered fan blade that spins and ejects granular fertilizer. However, the build quality is so poor that using it to get an even fertilizer dispersion is a hit or miss process.The battery compartment on mine was misaligned so that before I could use it I had to bend the connectors so they would contact the batteries (it takes 4 AA batteries, which are included). The compartment that houses the battery and fan blade snaps off, but the plastic is so thin and bendy that getting it back together is a chore. This does not have the build quality that gives me any measure of confidence that it will last for more than a season or two.Once I got it functioning it did spread out the fertilizer in a reasonably even spray. You can stop and start dispensing by pushing a lever at the base. Again, that&#8217;s not well-built and it sometimes jammed a bit in use.While the idea is good, the execution is very poor. If you have a small plot and don&#8217;t want to deal with a traditional broadcast or drop spreader, you&#8217;re far better off using a hand spreader or one of those new mini spreaders. The latter will take up more space than this product, but will do a better job by far. Plus, you can use better fertilizer than the stuff that comes with this, such as Milorganite. It won&#8217;t green your lawn as quickly, but it&#8217;s far longer lasting and there&#8217;s no danger of burning the lawn with too much nitrogen, or contributing to nitrogen runoff into streams.Nice idea, but not worth the trouble.

Just walk at a normal pace and the battery powered spreader does the rest.  With a small lawn you can have it fertilized in a few minutes.  To refill just pop the top back off and pour in a refill bag.  I've used a variety of fertilizer brands on my lawn and they all seem to do the job.  So far this one seems just fine as well.

I get the concept for a small area, however there are some drawbacks over just a simple, rotary hand spreader.  My Republic, hand-crank spreader throws about 15 feet, which makes it much easier to avoid the &#34;overlap stripes&#34; of missing and double-treated areas.  This unit throws about 6 feet (when the batteries are full power, less as the power drops).  This will make it more likely to have the stripes, missed areas, and spots (because of clumping of fertilizer the impeller can't break).  The unit I got had the pre-filled jug with the spreader attached, plus a &#34;refill&#34; bag.  I became disappointed within a row or two, and drained the contents into my hand spreader.  I was done much faster and felt more sure of the results.Having said all that, if you want to fertilize a small area and you don't already own some sort of spreader it will do the trick.  You also don't have to worry about storing partial bags of leftover fertilizer, as it just stays in the jug until you need to fertilize again.  A rotary hand-spreader is about $10 and 5,000 sq ft of the same type of fertilizer is about $15 tops.  When I checked the cost of this at $33 to do 2500 sq ft...it just doesn't seem like a great bargain to me."

Intuition does not work or at least did not work well for me.Turn the container upside down after reading the instructions.  Test the motor of the spreader to be sure it works satisfactorily.  Mine did not; however, this is where my electrical skills, huge overstatement, came in.  My motor would not work not even after resetting the new batteries.  I replaced Lebanon's batteries with 4 AA new ones I keep for special ocassions such as this.  It worked.  I did not change the supply door to a smaller size which I highly recommend.  After using the first application I closed the trap door to about  size and it worked better and obviously used less product.  Take the bottom off and then remove the paper disk.  Replace the bottom and begin the short process of walking the yard while spraying the lawn food.I sent my push spreader to the home for aged spreaders and kept my hand turning little spreader for all applications.  Now, the hand spreader has been relaged to the top shelf of the Hooisier Cabinet and out of the way.I do wish there were calibrators on the trap door so that I would know what 2,500 feet represents.  Of course, that is a varible that is almost impossible to solve since the batteries will fade with time and use.  Having the On/Off Switch on the back and bottom creates a minor problem for me when attempting to get the first amounts on the ground.When I finished my first application, I turned off the switch and waited for 2 days (just love that rain), refilled the container with the extra bag, a  trap door setting and all went well.

Note that it does come with a full load, but you can easily refill the container.  I spent a minute or two trying to get it to work, and no luck.  Found out that one of the batteries was in crooked; once I fixed that, I was up and running!It is just plain fun AND easy to use this thing.  Just pull out the yellow tab on the bottom, and a little motor whirs to life, doing a very nice and even spread.  Just walk around and watch the fertilizer fly.  I was able to apply fertilizer to my lawn (average suburban size) in about 5 minutes.  This happens to be quicker than pulling out my giant green Scott's push-fertilizer (and much less messy).  And this product takes up less room than my old spreader; just sits on the garage shelf.  The battery life seems good.  It uses four plain old AA batteries, so in future years I'll just pop in some of my rechargeable batteries and will be good to go.The spread pattern was far more even than when my push spreader (or my small hand-cranked spreader) offers.  My old methods always seemed to have certain messy spots with too much fertilizer, and others without enough, but this makes the distribution quite even around the lawn.  The only very minor hiccup I encountered was when the spreader seemed to stop spreading, but I just had to give the handle one quick &#34;heft&#34; and the fertilizer flowed evenly after that.Bottom line, I figured I would be laughing at the product, but instead I will be laughing at the neighbors when I watch them making a mess with their giant push-spreaders.

As the label says, this is an excellent product for use on small lawns, or on grassy areas that require maneuverability around trees, benches, walkways, or similar common yard obstructions.  To spread the fertilizer evenly and in the right amount, you simply turn the spreader on, and walk along in a strip pattern carrying the spreader by the top handle.This part was very easy, and I really liked being able to distribute the right amount without having to figure out how to apply a certain number of pounds of fertilizer per square foot.  (If you prefer doing it the old-fashioned way, this product calls for 3.2 lbs. per 1000 sq. ft.)  This fertilizer is 22-0-4 (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium). In my experience, fertilizers are pretty much the same, so I'm expecting my lawn to green up (22% nitrogen) and have some protection against drought and disease (4% potassium).  There's no phosphorus in this fertilizer, because phosphorus helps with flower production.The hard part for me, was figuring out how to open the battery-operated spreader part--which must be opened to remove the seal that keeps the fertilizer contents fresh, and to remove a strip that prevents the included batteries from going dead.  To open the spreader, you turn the container upside down, then turn only the UPPER part of the green spreader to open it.  There are a couple of tabs at one end that need to be disengaged before the spreader will open--these made the spreader very difficult for me to open, every time I needed to.When you close the spreader, make very sure that you've fully engaged those pesky little tabs again!  I didn't, and when I carried the container to my lawn, it came open and dumped the entire contents on my sidewalk.  It was a pain to clean up, but not a major disaster, because I was able to pour most of the spilled lawn food back into the container.  Even when it's reassembled correctly, the spreader tends to leak some bits of lawn food, so expect it to be a little messy.The refillable container and any unused lawn food can be stored in a cool, dry place.  The compact square container takes up hardly any space, compared to even a hand-held spreader (for example,Scotts 71030 Easy Hand-Held Spreader).WARNINGS include:Use only when grass is actively growing.Do not apply by hand.Do not apply to wet grass.Do not apply during periods of drought.Water lawn thoroughly after applying.Do not apply near water, storm drains or drainage ditches; do not apply if heavy rain is expected; sweep any product that lands on the driveway, sidewalk, or street back onto your lawn.Keep out of reach of children.Use protective eyewear when using battery powered spreader.Because the battery-operated spreader portion was so hard to open, I rate this product at 4 stars (\"I like it\" on the official Amazon scale)."

The instructions were a little hard for me to comprehend and some of the pieces were difficult to move.  Basically, you are twisting the bottom of the container and it pops off.  It feels like you are breaking it, but you are not.  Once I was able to get the container open and the battery installed, it was really easy to use.  If you look at the picture, the yellow thing on the bottom is the on off switch and the fertilizer comes out the bottom front.  It was very easy to use.  I have a very complex yard with a variety of landscaping.  I wanted to apply this only to the grassy areas and had no problem limiting it to those areas and avoiding the flowers and shrubs that I wanted to use a different mix on.  As I said in the summary, this particular mix is very high nitrogen and almost nothing else.  Depending on what your lawn needs, this might or might not be a good solution.  However, the package is designed so you can use it over and over with whatever fertilizer you want to use.  For this, I give it 4 stars!"

This also came with a 8 pound bag of lawn fertilizer. I liked the combination fertilizer and spreader in one and that's it's already pre-calibrated so you don't have to adjust the settings on it. I also liked that the leftover fertilizer can be stored inside the spreader and fits nicely on my garage shelf. A few days after I used it, the spots that received the fertilizer were greener and more grass had sprouted. So the fertilizer part worked excellently and is highly recommended.However, the spreader itself is terrible. The spreader fan blades that disperse the fertilizer continually became jammed and eventually didn't allow any fertilizer to get out, so now it's useless, even after I tried to clean it out. I ended up spreading the rest with my old push spreader. Bottom line, the spreader is junk but the fertilizer is fantastic and works extremely well so I'd recommend buying just the GreenView Lawn Food."

It's lightweight and doesn't take much effort to swing side to side.  It's already calibrated so you don't have to adjust any settings.  Doing the front yard 20 feet by 20 feet took about 10 minutes.GreenView fertilizers that do not contain weed control herbicides should be applied to dry grass just before rain. The fertilizer will need to be rained in or watered in to be effective.  Then you can mow after the fertilizer has been watered/rained in.  Any extra fertilizer you have can be stored in a dry place and reused again for later."

Basically you pull out the yellow lever to spread the lawn food and push it back in to stop.  If you get a clump of lawn food and it sticks then give it a shake.  You might also have to do this when it is getting low.As far as the lawn food effect on the garden, it seems to have improved and instead of getting scrappy looking grass there is some consistency there.  I also used this same spreader for putting 'moss out' in and for some grass seed and it worked well so the spreader would be useful for anything which is like small granules.So conclusion the actual lawn food product is excellent, the spreader is a great idea and you can use it for other things so good buy overall."

It essentially blows a pre-calibrated amount of fertilizer in front of you, with a fan. The spread is maybe a couple of feet forward and a cone-shaped pattern a foot or so wide. I found it necessary to wave the container back and forth as I was walking.When you get it, it looks as if the instructions are visible on the back label, but the real instructions are inside after you peel off the outer page. You first have to remove the bottom dispenser part, peel off a seal, and reinstall. The instructions say that you need to pull a tab that protects the batteries, but on the unit I received, there was no tab and the batteries had shaken loose during shipment and bent one of the terminal springs. So that was a few minutes of fussing with it to get the batteries back in place correctly.I noted that there was a plastic half-disc that rotated in the dispenser mechanism, seemingly unconnected to the on-off slider. It seemed to me that this could be used to regulate how fast the product dispensed, but the instructions were silent on that. Since GreenView claims it is pre-calibrated, and there's no marking on this disc, I have no idea if I was really putting down the correct amount of fertilizer.One can refill the jug with whatever kind of granulated fertilizer you want, which is nice, and the batteries are standard AA and replaceable.

Granted, it helps novice gardeners from making mistakes such as using a high nitrogen fertilizer on something such as tomatoes, but it also is somewhat unnecessary provided you read the formulation.This is a 10-7-7 fertilizer. The first number refers to nitrogen (helps with greening and foliage growth); the second is for phosphorus (promotes root growth); the third is for potassium (helps strengthen plant cells). It&#8217;s a good formulation for pansies but also can be used for other flowering plants.It also includes small amounts of sulfur (improves uptake of nutrients), iron (aids in plant health and improves the green color) and manganese (helps with iron absorption). All in all, a generally decent fertilizer formulation.The granules are small but not too powdery, and are uniform in size. It&#8217;s easy to spread and work into the soil. Watering after application is recommended and, given the high N content, you should take care not to get this on foliage (or wash it off if you do) to prevent burning.The cons are the cost &#8211; this is very pricey per pound, and there&#8217;s nothing special about the formulation to justify the cost. The other con is that only one-third of the nitrogen is from water insoluble sources (which for this fertilizer is feather meal, bone meal and meat meal). Water insoluble sources are important to prevent fertilizer run-off into streams and other water bodies, where it promotes algae blooms. While water soluble nitrogen works faster and gives you that quick &#8220;pop&#8221; of growth and color, it is not ideal due to run off.I&#8217;ll give this 3 stars.

Other plants might require different ratios to encourage the proportion of nourishment going to the green parts like leaves, or to flowers, or to root development, to name a few.These (10-7-7) properties are optimal for foliage, rooting, and the setting of flower buds. The organic ingredients strengthen the plant and improve overall soil health.Keep in mind, however, that fertilizers are only one factor in ensuring your pansies (or any other plant) grow beautifully, and that you need to understand your environment.In terms of soil, here are some questions to ask: What kind is it? What's the PH? What nutrients are present or lacking?Other factors include the weather and rainfall.

Pansies need more Nitrogen (the first number in the three-number ratio) because they grow and bloom in cold weather.  When soil temps drop below 60 degrees Fahrenheit, Nitrogen from Nitrates is necessary in a pansy's diet.  When it is cold out pansies can &#34;digest&#34; Nitrogen in the form of Nitrates easier than other forms of Nitrogen.By the time I received my bag of pansy food, it was getting a little late in the season for pansies, but I hurried and got an application onto the beds.  I noticed an improvement in the bloom size and color vibrancy within a week and a half.  The grains are uniform in size (with no dust to blow away in the wind), some of them are slow release, and it was easy to work into the ground.I also liked that there were different application rates provided for beds, round pots and square pots:  Now, that's getting down to the nitty-gritty--and left no questions in my mind as to the exact amount to use.If you have any left over, be forewarned that it is not suitable for use on consumable (food production) plants.This fertilizer contains organic fertilizer in addition to more usual &#34;conventional&#34; fertilizer material:  Feather meal, meat and bone meal, kelp, diammonium phosphate, calcium nitrate, potassium sulfate, ferrous sulfate and manganese sulfate.It is not always easy to find fertilizer for blooming plants that contain Nitrate Nitrogen.  This GreenView Pansy Food has 3.4% of its 10% Nitrogen in the form of Nitrate Nitrogen.  And that is a good thing.During the warmer months--beginning sometime in March, depending on where you live--pansies can take on and thrive with less Nitrate Nitrogen and you can turn to a more balanced diet (ratio) of Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium, plus trace elements."

I happened to have some hanging baskets in need of a bit of TLC since they were bought on the clearance rack at the local big box store. When this arrived I sprinkled some in, watered diligently for a few weeks and waited to see what would happen. Blooms all the way around! In fact, not only did my somewhat dubious looking hanging baskets of flowers fill out with new leaves and begin to bloom profusely but a few unknown hitch hikers draped down the sides and started to bloom as well. Additionally, I like the green factor of a more 'natural' type fertilizer even though this is only for flowers. Worked well in container/potted plants and resulted in significant leaf restoration as well as blooms."

This seems to do a good job, reading the bag it looks to be high in nitrogen, now I am not a fertilizer guy but what I can say is this. I know if you over fertilize you can burn your plants, under fertilize and nothing happens except you waste your money. What I can confirm is this fertilizer has not killed any of my plants that is has been placed around. I can't tell if it's helping, but it certainly isn't hurting. If you need fertilizer there is no reason why you shouldn't try this."

The iron content helps the leaves stay nice and green, and they are growing much faster than when I've not used it.  (I used Jungle Grow/Hyponex, instead of the more expensive potting soils that already have fertilizer in them to test this in my greenhouse- and this is really just as good.)I've also used this on pansy seedlings, in pansy seed starter mix, on full grown pansies, petunias, dianthus, and marigolds, and it really seems to encourage healthy plants and abundant, blooming.  I saw an increase in blooms just a few days after application.  I like to apply mine right before I know it will rain.  Wait 2-3 days, boom- Flower bomb!The extra nitrogen boost really helps keep flowers on the plants.I've also used this on very young cucumber and tomato plants, and they both seemed to like it, with vigorous plant growth."

Here, our pansies are behaving more  like perennials. Maybe it's 'cause the bed is sunny. Maybe it's 'cause we made our own soil mix-including composted steer manure, azomite, and worm castings.  Maybe the pansies try to thwart that big garden plunderer- The Moose..... Who knows? ..........It's been said that Alaska has a short growing season.

        "text": "The main differences between this and most other flower food is a higher level of nitrate nitrogen and a good dose of calcium.The nitrate nitrogen makes the fertilizer useful in prolonged cold weather (below 45 degrees), when pansies are still active but won't take up ammoniacal nitrogen. Too much ammoniacal nitrogen may also cause spindly growth during warm weather, so this formula balances the two, with a little over half the immediately available nitrogen in the nitrate form. It also includes slow release nitrogen in the form of feather, meat and bone meal.Some problems with pansy greenhouse plants have been traced to calcium deficiency. Most soils already have enough, but some growth mediums (i.e. the material the plants are typically grown and sold in), which rely on liquid fertilizers, don't. Curiously, this product doesn't include magnesium, which should also be present in soil in a certain balance with calcium to avoid boron deficiency, another particular issue with pansies.The guaranteed analysis for this 10-7-7 NPK product is 10% total nitrogen (N), including 3% ammoniacal N, 3.4% nitrate N, and 3.6% insoluble N; 7% phosphate (which gives the P number); 7% potash (the K number); 5% calcium, 4.5% of it soluble; 2.5% combined sulfur; 1% soluble iron; 0.3% soluble manganese.This 4-pound bag covers roughly 150 square feet at the recommended amount. Reapplication is recommended every 4-6 weeks.Application is easy, the granules are heavy enough not to blow away before you can lightly work them into the soil and water them.By the way, this fertilizer *is* safe for food production (contrary to what one review implies), but since it isn't organic, it isn't suitable for the production of *organic* food.The Lebanon in the manufacturer's name comes from Lebanon, Pennsylvania."

It also contains sulfur, but that is usually available in soil from decomposition of plants.  Almost all plants need nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium (these they need the most and are often abbreviated NPK for the chemical symbols), calcium, magnesium, and sulfur (these they need smaller amounts of, I put Epsom salt on my lilacs because they like a lot of magnesium and sulfer).  Pansies need these minerals as well as iron and manganese (called micro nutrients, they only need a little).This fertilizer is 10-7-7 or 10% Nitrogen 7% phosphorus and 7% potassium.  This is actually on the low end for percentage of active ingredients and for flowering potted plans I usually choose 15-30-15.  Since the main reasons we like pansies is the flowers, I am surprised that the 10-7-7 ratio, usually you want to reduce the nitrogen (slowing the growth) so the extra energy is put into flowering.  But I am not an expert on pansies, so perhaps they grow differently.That said, this is really expensive for the amount you get.  It&#8217;s a little dusty to apply.  I put this on my pansies in one pot with a control group of cheaper fertilizer in a second pot.  I will try to remember to come back and repost after I observe the growth."

The stomper definitely does the job.  I've always tamped down the leaves and grass with a scoop shovel.  That's always worked too but it's obviously not an option if you're using a bag and since the leaf stomper has more flat surface iit will compress a wider area than other tools.  I like that I can secure the rake handle into the stomper using my foot to open and close the spring loader.  One negative:  I used a lot of force to really compress my leaves.  Once done it was fairly difficult to remove the rake handle from the stomper.  There is a small indent at the bottom of the stomper to hold the rake handle.  The handle was jammed in there securely and I struggled to get it out.  I was afraid I was going to break the plastic stomper.  I didn't break it, though, and possibly if you're stomping into a bag you'll use less force and not have this problem.  But the bottom line is the stomper works and is a useful tool to add to your garden implements.  One other comment:  the stomper comes in a rigid blister pack. It's not the easiest packaging to open and requires a knife or scissors to remove the product. I would have preferred to see less packaging, i.e., something that is easier to open and uses less materials."

When they fall in the normal way the gods intended - over a few weeks, gently, in a nice even layer - they can be mulched by the mower. But this year, those buggers held onto their trees with all their little might while the cold weather got closer and closer and my poor hub cursed them for holding out on him. Finally, he had to winterize the mower.Five days later, the mother of all Fall wind storms rolled in and - Whomp! - leavage.So we got out the rakes and called the kids to come over and help (I promised chicken and dumplings for dinner afterwards.) The raking actually went pretty fast, but we had some HUGE piles of leaves. They set about bagging them and this cool tool really helped! We filled 9 bags which would have been maybe 15 without our &#34;leaf foot&#34; ... well, the kids and the hub filled 9 bags while I made dinner and played with the grands. Rank has its privileges.Bottom line is, this leaf packer-downer worked like a charm and no one had to use their hands and get covered with dirt and leaf schmutz. And when the leaves were packed and the bags lined up for the recycling truck, the grandson had quite a bit of fun making Bigfoot tracks in the soft soil next to the woods and we all got to help him &#34;fool&#34; his Mom into thinking that Bigfoot had walked through there.

Instead I can put it in my garden tool area and hang it on the wall and when needed pop it onto the end of my rake, +1 for that.I saw some other reviews mentioning that the design allows mud/dirt to cake in around the bottom and that is true. Thanks to the &#34;foot print&#34; design that can happen, however because of that same design it also acts like little knives as you push down on leaves. If this was totally flat like a cement tamper then leaves would be flattened but not &#34;chopped&#34;. So the design actually works well here, it would work better if you raked your leaves, put them in a bag and then used this purely in the bag to smash them down. BUT it also works well if you have a small pile somewhere and you just smash them on the ground, yes you may get some dirt caked on the bottom but a quick wash with the hose and problem solved.I like this tool, all to often you have to have special handles or attachments for things. I love the fact this works well with my existing tools, the solid construction and overall design of it. 4 stars, I am taking one star away, I do think this should be a little cheaper, at $9.99 it would be a great value, I think it should be closer to the $14.99 range instead of at the $19.99 range."

It has a purpose, and it works.The quality of the rigid plastic is excellent. It comes in a clamshell packaging in two pieces, the main shaft and the foot. Once the shaft is pressed into the foot, it's not going to come apart without some effort, though it's not supposed to. Its durable construction will stand up to any leaves or trimmings for which it is used to stomp. The stomper shaft has a strong, spring-leveraged hard-rubber grip on the inside, which opens when the rubber-coated foot pedal is depressed, most appropriately by stepping on it, in order to insert whichever garden tool handle one has at the ready.I was out of leaves, but I did have several half-barrels filled with dead tomato plants, which were long overdue to go out for green waste pickup, so I used it on those. I have garden tools with either bare wood handles, or foam rubber grip coated handles, and I used each type to test my Leaf Stomper. I started with the foam rubber grip hoe, and because I noticed a slight bit of play while stomping, it gave me the idea to try the wood only handle in it, and it wobbled a bit, too. Having thought about it, I guess it doesn't matter that it wobbled, it held in place like a champ, and it did everything it was supposed to do. It requires a diameter that will support what people might have on hand, so it was normal. This item works perfectly for what it is.If stomping leaves and trimmings were not enough, imagine the fun kids could have making footprints in the mud to pretend that there's a Bigfoot on the loose. This ten-inch stomper foot is shorter than my own foot, yet it is most definitely wider. It will easily fit into smaller bags, and it works brilliantly in my green waste bin with enough surface not to poke through things; it didn't pull anything up on its way out either.I've had to climb a stepladder before to stomp on thorny lemon tree prunings, so I guess this really would have been nice to have back then. I do recommend the EZ Lawn and Garden Leaf Stomper for those who do their own yard maintenance. It's engineered beautifully, from high-quality materials. This is a fine quality lawn care accessory, which is what my high marks reflect about the product."

I was going to buy an attachment that snaps onto the top of a garbage pail and hooks up to my leaf blower/vac so I can vacuum the leaves directly into bags.  However, I realized how much more work it would be to lug the pail around with me as I vacuum the leaves.This season, I resorted to mowing the leaves and bagging them, using my foot to repeatedly stomp the volume down after each time I emptied the mower bag.  I received this item in time for my last weekend of cleanup.  It made the job so much easier.  It did a great job of compacting the leaves so I didn't have to use my foot.  I&#8217;m looking forward to having an easier time next season thanks to this product.The only complaint I have is with the packaging.  It was in a plastic clamshell that was difficult to open."

We managed to use a little more than half the normal amount of bags for yard cleanup. The stomper also has the advantage of not ripping or smashing bags when you try to use your own foot to accomplish the same task.Just a good idea that someone should've thought of sooner (now maybe they can think of it at half the price - $20 for this is a bit steep, hence the four stars.)"

It's made very well, a heavy plastic and it has a good weight to it. It easily pushes down the leaves in your bag so you don't have to get in there to do it yourself. This is a great way to avoid ticks and I will recommend this to many people just for that reason, especially those who live in heavy tick populated areas.Because this has a cute look to it, I think the kids will enjoy using this product and helping out in the yard as well.

This has no bearing on the function of the stomper, just a heads-up for those who suffer from 'wrap rage'.Once it was freed from the packaging the stomper is in two pieces that easily snap together. Put it on the ground, press the foot pedal, attach a broom handle - I had a broken one lying around - and it's ready to go.The first thing I noticed was the size of the foot. It's smaller than I expected and another couple of inches might make it even easier to compress the leaves.The product description states that it allows packing up to 4X more in a standard recycling bag - that may be true if you never attempted to pack down the leaves at all. I was already compressing the leaves so I saw no real change in volume but it does make the job much easier. Previously I would jump in the bag and stop the leaves with my feet. Probably not the safest thing to do once the bag gets over half full and begins to tip over with me trying to get out of it. I was happy to find a safe, alternative way to stomp that accomplished the same task.Overall, a nice little gadget to help with yard cleanup."

The foot is ten inches long and provides a large enough stomping surface to compact leaves or other debris with as few possible movements while preserving maneuverability which would be hindered if the surface area was larger.It is winter but I still had leaves to rake (don&#8217;t judge) fallen from a large elm tree located in a neighbor&#8217;s yard. The tree is close to the fence separating our yards and each Fall, this variety is one of the last to drop its foliage, often not occurring until the end of November. This year after the bulk of raking was complete I let the elm tree debris slide. So, I had plenty to rake to test out the leaf stomper.Enough bending is necessary to bag the leaves, so I appreciate being able to stand, using the stomper to compress the leaves saving both trash bags, effort and my back. The pole which is not included, but virtually any yard tool handle will work, was easy to insert and remove via a foot pedal that opens and secures or releases the inserted handle. I also used the stomper to compress a large amount of packing paper that appeared to be in every package I received over the holidays."

I had a big dead branch fall from my tree and the wood was very fragile. In stead of standing there snapping each branch, I just went stomping thru my yard and made short work of the branches. Now they are all little pieces that will compost quickly over winter.Oh and another thing I noticed, when I lean the rake against the fence or a tree, the foot helps keep it standing there."

It has a spring loaded lever that attaches it to a rod -- like a rake rod or a broom handle.  So you obviously need to know that you'll have to provide the rod.At first I wasn't sure I was going to like the Stomper, but it was definitely useful -particularly to me.  I happen to have allergies to leaf mold.  It's not usually so bad that I don't rake, but it means that I wear gloves and that I like to reduce contact with the leaves.What I found with the Stomper is that I didn't have to hang my head over the leaf bag to crunch down the leaves by hand. I could stand up and compact them with the foot.  The foot isn't huge, but it's certainly bigger than my hands, and it fits into a variety of different sized bags.So, I'm happy I received it.  And I'd suggest it to others who are sensitive to leaf mold."

If they were $10, we might even buy a few more and give them as gifts.It might be worth mentioning, from an engineering POV, that the spines and extra air pockets designed into the molded shape appear to provide some added reinforcement and strength; the downside is that wet debris can get clogged in them.

Please note that used as directed, the business end of a rake or broom is up near your head. My husband correctly predicted that I'd hit myself in the head with the rake at least once. This is not for the clumsy or accident prone.Even though it is December in WI, we found enough leaves in our garage to get a bag of leaves going. The stomper part works well in allowing us to make full use of a bag. We also used this to tamp down Christmas wrapping into a garbage bag. The best use of this product seems to be to make monster footprints in the snow to delight the neighbor's kids.The stomper appears to be sturdy and well made. I'd rather have a dedicated pole for a handle than use a rake upside down (see head injury reference earlier). This strikes me as a Shark Tank type of inventor project but I think it will be of use next fall when we are again inundated with leaves. I think children would have fun tamping leaves with this but again I'd hesitate to have them use this as illustrated. Get a dowel and have this be a dedicated tool.ETA: 4/5/2014: it is now spring and the melting snow has uncovered a surprising amount of leaves! The stomper was very helpful in getting our kraft bags full. I used it without a handle extension and it worked just great."

Stomping the leaves made them more compact.Using a foot shaped tool is fun.  Yet leaves did move when I stomped on them in the garbage can because the can is big. A larger round or square stomper would have worked better. Even if you put leaves in bag I would think a larger round or square design would better.That being said raking leaves is tedious work for me.

That kind of stuff usually takes up a ton of room and requires several trash bags.  This probably cuts the amount of trash bags required in half.  That can be especially helpful when you have a large family Christmas at your house.Another use that I've found for it is to smash down snow in order for my little chihuahua to be able to go outside when the snow is too deep for her.  Wish this I can clear out a small area for her to be able to do her business.From using it for these 2 things, I can tell it'll be very helpful for smashing leaves.  This will be very handy and it won't take too long for it to pay for itself in the savings that you get from using less bags.I find the Stomper itself to be a very great quality.  It's nice and thick and a pretty decent size.  My only complaint would be that it doesn't have a handle of it's own.  I wish I didn't have to attach it to another tool in order to use it.

It weighs in at a little under 7.5 pounds. I couldn&#8217;t wait to try it out. Being that I live in western NY, that means washing the car in 35F! I wasn&#8217;t able to test the Lay-Flat technology feature of the hose because it says in the directions that the temperature should be above 70F.

I was able to connect it to my hose reel without the need for pliers. It threaded very easily and with the enclosed washer I had no leaks!The hose did not kink once while I was washing my car and I even ran it over with my car a couple of times to test the durability. No problems at all. There is also a reinforcement cuff that Scotts calls &#8220;Hose Armor&#8221; to prevent kinking at the spigot. This is a real nice touch and it works great.The hose is also drinking water safe.

It's a much better connection.The other thing I liked is that you &#34;can&#34; officially drink from these hoses...years ago it was discovered that normal hoses have lead and other problems in them and it was advised that people not drink from hoses (so all those years as a kid drinking from the hose was actually living dangerously!).  That small detail makes me look to this as higher quality than other hoses.  Otherwise, this is a good length, doesn't seem to kink when I pull it around my raised planters, and feels strong.

I used to buy cheap department store hoses, but they usually didn&#8217;t last and would kink a lot.  The last time around I spent a bit more and got a better quality hose.  I found it was thicker and more durable, but still kinked often - even though it was advertises as &#8220;no kink.&#8221;  I have a lot of landscaping and as I wind around shrubs, flowers, rocks, trees, and paving, I almost always end up with a hose kinked, or stuck on something.  Then I have to stop what I am trying to do, go back and free up the hose, etc.Enter the Scotts MaxFex.  While it is still winter and my use of this hose has been limited, I have used it to wash the cars and flush a gutter.The hose measures 50 feet in length.  The couplings appear to be brass; they are marketed as being lead free.  The entire hose is advertised as lead-free, which makes it &#8220;drinking water safe.&#8221;This is not an inexpensive hose.  However, for the extra $10 or $20 you may spend, to me &#8211; it is well worth it.  The hose is clearly made very well.  The couplings are heavy duty and the hose has a nice feel to it.  You can see and feel that it is reinforced.  It has what Scotts calls &#8220;Lay Flat&#8221; technology.  Basically it tends to keep its shape, which helps it resist kinks.  They refer to it as being &#8220;kink resistant&#8221; which I am fine with, as I hate to buy a &#8220;kink free&#8221; hoses that kink.  At least here, they are telling you it should avoid kinks, but &#8211; just about anything flexible can kink.I keep my hoses in storage containers made for that purpose (decorative with a cylinder in the middle to wrap the hose around).  Even with my decent hoses, I tend to have to fight and exert some strength to roll the hose around and around into the container.  Yet with the MaxFlex, I found it recoiled quite nicely, allowing me to more easily roll it into the storage container.In the short time I have had it, this hose has demonstrated an ability to maintain shape, recoil very easily, and to avoid kinks.  In fact, not a single kink yet &#8211; again I have used it just 2 or 3 times.What has really pleased me is the way it keeps its shape and tends to continue to slide around things as you pull it, rather than become snagged on things.  People often complain about a hose that kinks, but to me snagging on things is just as bad.  I hate having to stop what I am doing, retrace my steps and go free up the hose from whatever it got caught on.  So far, this hose has tended to slide freely around objects and hasn&#8217;t snagged &#8211; even once.I will update the review as I continue to use it.To me, this hose is well worth the extra cost versus an average hose.  I am buying a second one for the yard.Scotts also backs it with a limited lifetime warranty."

I have seen no evidence of situations that lead to that. It may be because I have been using the hose in warm weather (mid-70s to low-80s). Or it may be my usage pattern. When I want to extend the hose to a set position, I don't drag it, but carry and uncoil. When I am dragging a hose during watering, I am moving slowly, which gives the &#34;Lay-Flat technology&#34; time to balance out the coils and avoid the situations that I see leading to kinking with other hoses.When I am done using the hose, it has curled nicely -- it has memory of being curled, but little bias about the diameter (I have done a medium and large diameter).The female hose connector is wonderfully large. I had no problem gripping it even with muddy hands.Experience: I have used (deployed) this hose about 6 times in the month I have had it (I received the product in exchange for an honest, timely review).-- Douglas B.

        "text": "The Scotts MaxFlex hose is wonderful.  I cannot review all the features the hose is advertised as having due to the cold weather here (and everywhere).  I can tell you what I have learned this far.We used it the day after receiving it, and it came just in time to prevent what could have been a catastrophe. Our winter has been horrid, not unlike most of the USA.  Our snowfall for the winter is double the normal amounts and it has piled high in our yard, driveway and walks coupled with sub-freezing temperatures.  I believe it was almost a full month in our area where the temperature never got above 20 degrees or maybe it did get into the low 20's.Suddenly we had a couple of days of warmer weather coupled with thunderstorms that caused flooding conditions in our yard.  With a driveway that slopes downward toward our house the melting snow and rain brought a cascade of water toward our garage door.  There is a grating with a drain at the lower end of the driveway that normally handles any torrential rainfall without problems.  This time it was overwhelmed.We have a submersible pump that we use for draining our hot tub when it is time to clean it and many hoses as well to use with it.  Unfortunately, the hoses were stored in an outdoor shed which could not be reached due to a 3-4 foot high snow accumulation covering the yard.  Plus, they are all 75 feet in length which causes a diminished flow rate when pumping.  Hot tub maintenance isn't urgent so they worked fine for that purpose.The new Scotts MaxFlex was 50 feet long and it hooked up perfectly to the submersible pump.  The hose instructions caution you to begin the hose initial setup in 70 degree + temperatures, and we could only partially do that.  The indoor temperature where the hose was stored was in that temperature range, but outside it was about 35 degrees at the time.  The female fitting coupling is brass not plastic and is larger than the normal coupling.  It measures 1 1/2\" in diameter, making it simple and easy to connect and disconnect. No tools needed to tighten or loosen and absolutely no leaks at the joint.  Once we made the hose connection and turned on the pump the shorter length let the water fly out of the hose and it kept up with the massive melting with ease.  We could pump the water out past the part of the driveway that slopes downward and out toward the storm sewers in the street.The hose did unroll easily, and did lay flat without kinks or curling, but the \"snap back\" feature wasn't even tried.  By the time the water flow had ceased, almost 2 1/2 hours, the hose was virtually frozen.  Soft and pliable at the start it was quite rigid when we pulled it into the garage.  We just dragged it in and put it anywhere we could so we were finally able to close the garage door and get out of the cold.  We did not attempt to recoil it because of the coldness that night, but it remained unkinked as it laid on the floor.  By the following morning it seemed it had attempted to recoil itself, but because it was all wrapped around chairs and benches in the garage that was not doable.  We were able to manually recoil it without difficulty later that afternoon once it had warmed.  There is a white or light yellow line about 1/8\" wide running the length of the hose that I suppose is to let you know if the hose is twisted.  We were only concerned with the urgency to remove the water as any flooding in the garage area would have continued into the recreation area of our home that is on the same level as the garage floor.  I did not look to see if there was any twisting in the hose that day, but in the summer that would be a benefit if twisting would prevent the anti-kinking feature.My opinion, given the task it was given to perform, even though it may cost more than cheaper hoses, is that this is an extraordinary value for a garden hose.  We always keep our hoses in a \"roll-up\" storage case and it always proves impossible to reroll the hose because it curls and kinks as it rewinds.  This hose will never suffer those troubles.It is the best!By the way, we can finally see bits of grass in our yard after weeks and weeks of constant snowfall.  Of course, the weekend forecast is for up to an additional 13\" of snow!  Hasn't this been a wonderful winter?  ( I know this has nothing to do with a product review, but the need to complain is overpowering!)"

They are not brass but seem to be gold / yellow anodized aluminum -- still seem to be heavy duty. If you like to wear gloves when using a hose like I do, you may find it easier to attach and detach it from the spigot than other hoses.

This hose is of high quality and the fittings are bar none the nicest fittings I've seen on ANY HOSE. However, if you are looking for a premium hose, I like Gilmour's Flexogen line better, and here's why:1.  They don't kink.  This one kinked about 3 minutes into using it.2.  Lifetime warranty.  This one has a warranty for the \"stated period\" but no where on the packaging or the Scott's website actually tells you how long the warranty is.I don't think the Flexogen line is marked as safe for drinking water so if that's important, go with this hose. Here's a link to the hose I bought.Gilmour 10 Series 8 Ply Flexogen Hose 5/8 Inch x 50 Feet Green Plus Gilmour 573TF Nozzle 10-573TFSAs of this writing, that hose is $33.14 on prime and this Scott's hose is $39.97 so you're paying more for a hose that I don't think is as nice.So overall this hose is fine but the point of this review is that at this price point I think there are better hoses on the market.Hope this helps."

As someone with not particularly strong hands or wrists, I really appreciate the design of the hose coupler.  It is easy to grasp and I could turn it tightly enough not to leak without using pliers.  A big thank you to whoever came up with this design.  Another welcome feature is that the hose curls the way I want it to.  I keep it in a large pot, so I want a larger circle of hose and not the tight ring it came in.  It was so easy to place it neatly in the pot, and it willingly goes back into the new, looser curl.  The hose it replaced wanted to curl tightly, even after years of use, so it was always tangled.  I have four garden hoses, and this is by far my favorite.  Eventually I'll replace the other three with Scott's MaxFlex - it is the best garden hose I've ever owned.Added 5/6/2014: I have learned that I need to carefully unwind this hose out of the pot.  If I simply pull it out of the pot as I walk across the yard, it will kink in multiple places.  It is still the best hose (by far) for curling into the pot, it lies flat and it never tangles, so I'm not deducting stars for the kinks."

Nevertheless, the hose is definitely easier to manage than the hose it is replacing.Do I recommend the hose? Absolutely. It is not a bargain hose, but you aren't getting bargain value either.

It coils and uncoils easy and has a heavy weight without being difficult to drag around. The fittings are high quality and don't leak at all even with the mediocre faucets installed in my yard. I'm so impressed with this hose I'm going to replace the others in the next few weeks since it stands heads and shoulders above the others.

        "text": "From fresh water to pressure washing gear, I've probably used just about every Swan hose that was ever made. For the most part overall quality has been good. If there was a weakness to any of their products it was the couplings on their cheaper hoses. I haven't had that problem in recent years. Swan makes almost every American made hose out there. That includes this Scott MaxFlex hose. So it was a no brainer to take this one for a test run. After four weeks use these are my thoughts.Timing was perfect. I was going to replace my older camping hose anyway. Measuring in at 5/8\" x 50' and weighing a little over seven pounds this Scott version is lighter then my older hose. I'm alright with that. The lead free aluminum couplings are not new features by any means. Most of Swan's hoses have been outfitted with these for quite some time. Still it works. I like the re-enforced vinyl covering. Unlike the cheap imported knock offs, its first rate and won't fray or peel. I can even live with the yellow line.On my first real test I laid the hose out to the max. I ran water through it a couple of times and drained it. Unfortunately the lay flat technology didn't show up. Even with the hose filled with water it still has a tendency to kink. For fresh water use its treated with bacteria and mold inhibitors. Still nothing gets rid of the taste of a new hose except constant use. I broke out this hose on several occasions since my initial test. Same kinking problem. For me personally I find this hose to be an average tool for camping or light gardening.The couplings on this product are first rate and definitely the best part of this hose. Still, this hose is too light for heavy duty use. Besides the constant kinking, a big ping against this particular product is the price tag for a 50' light duty hose. Its way overpriced for what it does not provide."

The two warm spring days in the Chicagoland area we have had thus far were spent teaching one of the kids to ride their bike and not cleaning cars.  Regardless, I rolled out the hose on a rather chilly spring day and gave it a shot.The temperature when I used the hose was 48F.  Why am I mentioning this?  The directions on the hose recommend setting the hose up when it is above 70F.  Despite being well below the recommended temperature, the hose did indeed lay flat on the ground as advertised.  Despite being left out overnight in around freezing temperatures and being only around 50F when I used it, the hose remained soft and pliable in the cool weather, even after running cold water through it.  It remained easy to coil up by hand while my other &#8220;good&#8221; hose was stiff and would only easily make large loops when I tried to coil it up by hand.Walking around the yard, I personally did not experience any kinks in the hose nor did I see any portion of the hose threatening to kink if I pulled it tight.  It remained fairly flat to the ground and did not bunch up.I thought the connectors to the hose were excellent.  Prior to obtaining this hose, I had no idea that the quality of hose connectors varied.  The female end of the hose is large and textured.  This makes it easy to grab and the design of the connector makes it incredibly easy to thread the fitting on the spigot.  I did not have to fight with the fitting to get it threaded on the spigot like I did with my other hoses.  The male end is just as easy.  The hose attachment threads right onto the hose fitting.The only drawback I had with this hose was the female fitting.  I ensured the washer was in place and that it was seated into the female fitting, but the connection still leaked.  I tried it on several different spigots and attaching it to the male end of another hose but the hose still leaked at the female fitting.  In all due fairness this hose leaked a lot less than my other hoses when I tried those.  Perhaps this is being caused by the cold shrinking the rubber washer.  For now, I am deducting a star for that reason.  If it works better when it gets above 70F, I will adjust my rating accordingly.If someone had told me that it was a worthwhile investment to spend around $1 per foot on a garden hose, I would have thought they were out of their mind.  I would have said that my 100 foot hose I got from a warehouse store for $30 works just fine.  However, after trying a quality hose like this one, I will be replacing my cheap hoses as soon as funds allow.  I highly recommend this hose!  Fighting with stiff hoses that bunch up and kink every time tension is put on them will be a thing of the past!"

So when I had the chance to hook this hose up I was interested to compare it to the one I had already.First impressions, this hose is heavy literally but built solid. Instantly you can tell the ends are quality as they are heavy duty connectors, they didn't skimp at all.When unrolling the hose it didn't want to roll out, it &#34;remembered&#34; it's coiled position and I had a hard time putting the sprinkler where I wanted it because the hose kept coiling back up pulling the sprinkler. I finally turned the water on and after a few minutes of running water through it the hose straightened out.I really have no complaints over this hose except the price. I typically spent $20 on a hose, and like I said the ones I have used previously always kink so I do think this one is built better which would justify a higher cost, but at $33.99 it's a bit more then I think it should cost.

The result - after one year of use, it was leaking from the connector (where it connects to the hose material), it kinks every time I use it and it has become stiff as a board.  Its last act of defiance was developing a crack and leaking somewhere down the line.I almost wrote a bad review for this hose 2 days after I received it.  When I first hooked it up, getting this hose to stay on my hose hanger was like wrestling with a boa constrictor.  It wanted to go its own way and I couldn't get it to stay where I wanted it when stretched out.  So I stretched the hose out and let it stay fully extended for 2 days...now it is very easy to manage.I am impressed that this hose is drinking water safe, probably because it is lead-free.  I don't drink from a hose but it is good to know it does not contain trace amounts of lead.  I am also impressed by the connectors on this hose - top quality.  I'm willing to bet this thing will last a while.After a week of use, I find that this hose still kinks from time to time but mostly behaves.  It is light years better than the one I had before.

Maybe it's because I tend to buy $20 garden hoses at Home Depot.Well this Scotts MaxFlex garden hose retails at $45 and it's definitely nicer than my $20 hoses.  The hosing is more rugged, the valves are more rugged, the hose doesn't kink that easily.

My garden hoses always want to leak at the coupling, but this coupling is firm and tight.What I like least is the bright yellow stripe down the center of the bright green hose.  The stripe is much more noticeable than you would expect from the product page photo, although it's not all that hard to get used to.Unlike the cheap garden hoses that I've been using, this hose is made of \"drinking water safe\" materials, and includes a \"bacteria/mold inhibitor\" to protect the hose.  However, to keep the hose safe for drinking water, it needs to be drained when not in regular use.  As the instructions say, \"Water left in a hose for extended periods of time may result in the formation of bacteria.\"This garden hose does NOT kink easily, and it's easy to coil back onto the hose holder after use.  To maximize the hose life, I always drain out some water after I turn off the spigot, because I use a \"control-top\" garden spray nozzle.  Sunlight or cold can expand the water left inside, and cause the hose to burst or leak prematurely.  The instructions recommend storing the hose indoors \"when not in use\", which I think means during the winter months.The hose has a limited lifetime warranty against defects in materials or workmanship \"under normal, residential, non-commercial use, for the 'Warranty Period'\".  Defective hoses will be exchanged for new ones of equal or better quality."

First, notice it is 5/8 inch instead of the 1/2 that one might grab to save a few bucks. There is nothing skimpy about any feature:  the fittings slide right onto the spigot, and the black rubber/silicone grip at the ends just makes the hose easy to control, besides relieving possible stress at the joint. It does coil nicely, and is not too heavy for its size.  I do expect it will last a lifetime."

The walls on this hose are very thick and I believe this will last a full summer, at least. I also look at the fittings to see if they are of high quality metal and these are. The fittings attached to my outdoor faucets with no problem, no leaks. The only downside is that this hose is a little heavy, even with no water, so if you're looking for something lightweight, keep looking."

I waste more time trying to connect my hose than I do actually using it sometimes. And while no hose is truly &#34;kink free&#34; this is the best one I have seen so far. The hose armor protects the spigot end from kinking and from overzealous pulling. It is also drinking water sale for those hot days when only hose water will work."

        "text": "I \"KNOW\" hoses! Having spent my entire life as a landscaper, the only people who handle hoses more than I do are firefighters!The primary purpose of a hose is simple: deliver LIFE-SAVING water to plants. Yeah, you can fill a child's swimming pool, wash your car, and clean the sidewalk but the main reason why garden hoses were invented was to deliver water from the spigot to your garden, without you becoming \"Jack & Jill went up the hill, to fetch a pain of water.\"That's why I'm CONSTANTLY confused as to the \"WHY?\" people that spend $100's and $1,000's of dollars on their landscaping, will go the CHEAPEST ROUTE POSSIBLE, in regards to the most basic of garden equipment. WHY, people, WHY?If you buy a GREAT quality hose (and this is one of them), it can literally last you decades. If you truly care for it as a valuable piece of equipment, it can last you a lifetime. So, skip those 150' hoses that sell for $20 bucks that kink as soon as you unwrap them, blow their walls from the constant P.S.I. that is required to contain the water, and couplings so fragile, that one single accidental tug will break the seal, allowing water to leak everywhere.So, \"How Do You Know A Hose Is Worth The Money?\" First, ask your landscaper! See what THEY use! If you don't have a landscaper, go with quality brand names such as \"Swan\" and \"Gilmore\". Although this hose is sold under the \"Scott's\" brand name, it's manufactured by SWAN, a hose company that I've used for decades of hard/daily use.Start with the couplings that connect a hose to your spigot: Are they solid? Are they brass? Are they of substantial weight? In this hose, the answer is \"Yes!\" to all of these questions. The couplings are actually oversized, with a nice tooled \"grippy\" surface, making it easy to connect to your spigot.Then, a critical piece: DOES IT HAVE AN ATTACHED WASHER! A 'washer' is that little rubber 'thingy' that seals the connection between hose and spigot....often times, when your hose is 'leaking' at the spigot, it's because you've lost the washer. This is VERY easy to happen: when the hose has been attached to the spigot for a fair amount of time, when you unscrew it, often the washer will become 'stuck' to the end of the spigot, then falls off, and you've lost it for good. Be sure that you always check your hose for the washer, every time you take it off of the spigot. Now, in the online sale of this hose, the washer is INSIDE the coupling, where they always used to be placed. In stores, because of the high THEFT factor from people stealing them to replace lost ones at home, they are usually threaded through the cables that bind the hose together. NEVER BUY A HOSE THAT DOESN'T HAVE A WASHER!Okay, you've checked the coupling. You've got a washer. Now what? There should be a good 4\"-5\" area, directly under the coupling that has either a brass spring or hard rubber area, that keeps the hose rigid at the spigot, so the weight of the hose doesn't kink immediately, cutting off your water supply. THIS hose has a very nice black rubber collar that is 4\" in length, preventing all future kinks at the water source. Swan calls their collar \"Hose Armor\"...cute. :DNow, as to the hose: IS IT HEAVY? Weight is everything with a hose and a standard 5/8\" hose that's even 50 feet long, should weigh A LOT, even when bone dry. That weight equals the heft of the walls and reinforcement of the hose's construction. The weight on this hose is substantial.Next, look at the walls of the hose: is there a pattern or waffling along the walls, indicating that they are reinforced. The walls are very reinforced on this hose, allowing it to hold the 40 p.s.i. (40 pounds per square inch of pressure) that is standard from homes.Added bonuses to THIS hose include: 1) Drinking water safe, which is important if pets or kids or even landscapers are going to be quenching their thirst from this hose! 2) An inhibitor against mold/bacteria has treated the hose. It doesn't say \"where\", I'm guessing it's the actual material. and 3) The brass coupling is LEAD-FREE, especially important for safe water delivery to you, your fish pond, your kids or pets.Two more notes: NEVER BUY MORE HOSE THAN YOU NEED 90% OF THE TIME!!! If you ONLY need 40' of hose 90% of the time, then owning a 100-150 foot hose is Overkill to the Extreme! Not only does that bulk of the hose get nasty that's not constantly used, from being in soil, dirt and mud, but that's the area that mold can build up in the hose, when not in use. Plus, the area not used is almost certain to ultimately kink, simply because it's not being used and sitting in the same position for months/years will age it. If you only need an additional 25-50 feet of hose 2-3 times per year, then buy ANOTHER HOSE to hook up to the female end of the hose, and then detach it and hang it up to dry when not in use, then coil it up and attach the coils with cable ties.Second note: ALWAYS DRAIN AND BRING YOUR HOSE INDOORS FOR WINTER! Nothing ages a hose more than being left outside, attached to your spigot. Not only can water freeze in the hose, driving it into the spigot and your home, but the ice expands and can rip a hole in the side of the hose. Drain the hose by removing it from the spigot, lay it flat on your lawn, then pick up an end and begin coiling it up, allowing the hose to dictate the direction it wants to be coiled. This makes it easy to store and also drains all the trapped water inside of it. Attach together with joined cable ties and you've now Winterized your hose for the following year. And store your precious nozzle away from freezing, too. Just be sure to check that the nozzle's washer is also inside the unit when you put it away.If you follow these steps about buying a QUALITY HOSE and how to STORE IT, you'll be passing this along to your grandchildren!"

        "text": "I have had quite a few bad hoses, so this one was a very big improvement. The guard around the spigot end, aka the \"Hose Armor\" makes it a bit more difficult to attach the hose if you are using it with a hose reel. It is quite heavy and a bit awkward, but it rolls smoothly around the hose reel once you get it attached. I water my hanging plants every two days in mild weather, and usually daily once the summer gets here, so I use a hose on a regular basis. I tried extending this with one of my old hoses, and while there wasn't any problem connecting the two, the old hose was very prone to kinking, which is a problem I have had with every hose I have tried except for the MaxFlex.Recommended, however, depending on the size of your yard, it might be economical to buy the 100 foot long version (the product link isn't working for the 100 ft version, but try putting B00E1HXYG0 in the search bar and it will come up) of this."

However, even the best hose tends to fail me eventually.  Kinks are my worst enemy, requiring me to stop what I am doing in order to walk back and unkink the hose.  Connectors can also be problem.  They can leak and even break which is extremely frustrating.  When I got a chance to get the MaxFlex I was a little skeptical as I have had many other hoses fall me in the past.The first thing that I noticed was the very heavy-duty couplings .  They seem almost over-sized and the spigot is reinforced with a plastic sleeve which Scotts calls &#34;Hose Armor&#34;.  When I first received it I followed the directions and rolled it out and let it lay in the sun (they suggest to do this when the temperature outside is a lease 70 degrees).  The helps to made the hose more flexible after being stored and shipped in a coil.Once straightened out for a while the hose is pretty flexible but rigid enough keep from kinking.  I have been using it for only a couple of weeks and, I my experience, it takes at least a year or two in order to tell whether a hose like this is worth the money.  I will update this review later in the year and it meets up to it's promises I will be happy to upgrade my rating to five stars."

It performs exceptionally well and is obviously very durable as it is made of heavy stainless steel. The needle shaft is as large as any others I have come across yet still inserts easily into whatever meat you are injecting. I do own one very similar injector but the other one lacks the second needle which is for minced marinades. The standard needle has the smaller holes along all the sides of the needle shaft. and no hole at the end of the needle. That needle is great for injecting meats with the store bought injectable marinades, or if you are like me, you can quickly make your own on the stove in a single pan for much cheaper and with better flavor. By minced marinades, I mean being able to use finely minced fresh garlic instead of the powdered garlic and using finely diced jalapeno peppers and such. The mince needle doesn't have any of the smaller holes along the shaft which would quickly clog up when using any marinade containing ingredients much bigger than coarsely ground black pepper. I've even had those smaller holes clog up while using similar injector needles when using marinades containing larger-type dried seasonings such as basil and it's no fun when that happens. Instead, the mince needle has one large hole at the tip which is cut diagonally allowing the most space possible for larger seasonings to exit. Even with the standard needle with holes up and down the shaft, to distribute your marinade evenly so you don't end up with large season pockets, you need to insert the needle into the meat and then slowly pull the needle out while pushing down on the plunger. This is of course even more important with only the one hole at the tip of the needle. With practice, you will be cooking the most moist and best seasoned meats possible with the center of the meat being just as favorable as the outside.

I prepared a turkey tenderloin using a mixture of melted butter, fresh minced sage, and salt an pepper. Basic I know but delicious! The tip allows for minced herbs to injected easily. It penetrates the meat well and easily, allowing buttery sage-y goodness to infuse the turkey.Clean up is a breeze due to its dishwasher safe status. I really recommend that you toss that freebie injector, if it hasn't broken already, and get the last injector you will likely need. Hurray Mr. Grill, job well done!"

        "text": "I think leaf mulch is the best, my county even recycles the leaf collection back to the public as a branded product.  I compared this product to my TORO handheld electric blower/mulcher with chrome impellar and a Craftsman gasoline chipper, mainly ued for branches and incidentally leaves.Packaging is pretty good and everything arrived undamaged.  It was pretty easy to assemble; I did not even need to use instructions!  The legs are made from aluminum and are height adjustable (with measurement markings).  Even if you are fairly short or tall, you should be able to set the height to your liking.  The rest of it is made from sturdy plastic.  The motor is quite strong and since it's electric will require barely any maintenance.  The cutting mechanism is merely heavy guage weed wacker string.For dry leaves and thick twigs, I thought this shredder worked fairly well.  I mounted it inside my garbage can, since I didn't have any wide mouth bags that would fit (and it doesn't come with one...)  Ear protection and eye protection are a must as this thing gets very loud and the top is fairly open and could potentiall throw twigs out.  After the first couple handful of leaves, the fine dust coats the hopper and makes most of the leaves slide into the shredder easily.  Sometimes, I used long twigs to help it along.  I confess, it was tempting to use my hands to mush the leaves in, but if you look into the mouth of the shredder, you realize it will take your fingers off and mangle your hand, in less than a second.  I fed this machine a mix of dry pear leaves, pine needles, and twigs of varying sizes.  What I got was some nice mulch quickly which I then dumped promptly into my garden bed. I also got a runny nose from all the fine dust, so if you have a surgical mask, I recommend you wear that too.  The legs pop off easily and I store all the pieces inside one of those very large black plastic disposable planters.For comparison, the SunJoe is is farily well built compared to the other two tools I mentioned above.  You have to have a lot of patience with the TORO if you are going to mulch a large pile of leaves with it since the vacuum intake is a bit smaller and long twigs jam it up pretty easily.  The Craftman is like bringing a bulldozer to a garden bed if all you want to do it mulch leaves and twigs.  As a one-task machine, the SunJoe works quite well."

        "text": "Every time we rake and bag leaves (which is often-- there are so many trees where I live that Direct TV won't even try to provide service...), I am struck by the wastefulness.  I feel like giving leaves, which could be a good fertilizer, to someone else to mulch is wasteful, the carbon footprint of the truck that picks up the bags is wasteful, and the bags themselves are wasteful.  But of course if you leave your leaves on the ground, they kill the grass.  This electric leaf shredder is (almost) exactly what I always wanted.PROS:+ The big one of course is that this solves the wastefulness problem outlined above.+ Makes nutrient-mulch for your garden.  This is easy to distribute and I just rake it in a bit.+ Collects in whatever bag or container you prefer+ Easy set-up+ Has settings for dry or wet leaves/clippings+ Has settings for fine, medium, or coarse grind, or pine needles.+ Height-adjustable+ Comes with replacement cutting line (like weed-whacker line but thicker)+ Easy to string replacement line+ Very fast with dry leaves+ Teenagers less likely to avoid leaf chores as they see this as both effort-saving and cool.CONS:- Loud loud LOUD!  The first time we tried it we thought it was going to explode.- Damp leaves can be mulched almost as quickly as dry, but they need a little help.  I use the butt of my rake to push them down; they just don't slide as easily down the hopper as dry leaves.BOTTOM LINE:Saves some effort as opposed to bagging, is less wasteful than bagging/collecting, makes a nice mulch for your garden, time-efficient with dry leaves - less so with wet.TIP:  Wear glasses in case of blowback."

        "text": "This is basically a weed wacker head that is mounted at the base of a large funnel. The spinning line rips apart the leaves you feed through the top, reducing the volume by a considerable amount (in theory, at least).The build quality is pretty good. It's mainly plastic, but the hopper is reasonably sturdy.  I also liked that it was packed well by the manufacturer in the box, so it can withstand being bounced around by UPS.It has legs that can be adjusted so you can position a yard waste bag under the discharge chute, which is held in place by an elastic cord. That worked sort of OK in holding the bag. I had much better luck using the hopper on top of a garbage can with a bag in it. That keeps the side blow back to a minimum, ensures the collection bag does not fall off, and provides for a more sturdy work platform.The motor certainly has some power to it - it's a 13 amp motor which spins the head at a no load speed of 8,000 rpm (as listed in the manual). The cutting head has two attachment points for the cutting line. No tools are needed for line replacement - just feed the line through the holes and loop it to attach. The result is that there are 4 cutting lines. The stock cutting line is 0.1 inch in diameter, so it's something you can pick up in a bulk spool instead of having to buy the replacements from SunJoe.There's an adjustment lever on the side that allows you to select how fine you want the leaves chopped. The adjustment lever turns a plate at the bottom of the hopper which determines how much time the leaves spend in contact with the cutting line. A fine level closes off the holes, keeping the leaves in contact longer for more chopping. A coarse level lets the leaves fall through quicker, and thus does not subject them to as much chopping.It worked great on dry leaves. I had a sack of leaves that I keep forgetting to put out on the curb, so they have been drying to the point of being quite crisp. The mulcher went to town on those - just mowed right through and created a pretty fine leaf mulch. It also processed the leaves pretty quickly.But, when it came to fresher leaves, the performance was not nearly as good. Even though the leaves were only a bit damp, the mulcher struggled to get through them in a manner that made a significant reduction in their volume. It was much, much less effective (in terms of volume reduction) than using a handheld blower vac. It was also more time consuming, since it you have to feed the hopper slowly to prevent an overload.I then tried some really wet leaves. Even with the control lever set to the wet leaf setting, the strings just could not get through them. The motor labored even with just a modest amount in the hopper.The problem is with the cutting lines - it needs to have more than 4 lines or, better yet, a combination of string lines and plastic \"blades\" to get through anything other than bone dry leaves. A handheld blower vac works better since it has a spinning set of plastic or metal blades. That's a far more effective chopping device than 4 pieces of string trimmer line.I tried using some better quality string line (some twisted Gator line) instead of the stock line. That helped a little, but not enough to make a big difference.This does have some value, especially if you have to pay for leaf pickup (some localities charge by the bag for pickup). It certainly is easier on the back than hauling around a blower vac. But the limited effectiveness it has on damp leaves (and VERY limited effectiveness on truly wet leaves), plus the slow processing speed keeps my rating at 3 stars.I'd also suggest cross-shopping this with the WORX WG430. It's a very similar device, but it has a better system for holding the bag in place (uses a ring rather than elastic cords). The cutting mechanism of the WORX (or other similar models) is the same as this one, however, so it will also struggle with less than crispy dry leaves."

So, I did enough to put this to the test before tiring and taking my machine home.I tried the various settings and there was some difference in the size of what came out. I was surprised by how much went through untouched on the coarsest setting. But, most was much smaller. This time of the year, the grass isn't tall enough to mow, so I couldn't test that shredder feature yet.Bottom line in use: it does chop up leaves. Comparatively, a line trimmer dipped into a trash can will do a similar job without the cost and storage of another item, but it is much messier. Yes, I have done that by fitting a plastic bag cover around the top of the trimmer and over the trash can. This machine is neater, quicker and easier, though.The assembly was very easy and the instructions were well written. The telescoping legs are a definite plus both in use and for storage. Extra lines are included. It will easily disassemble and store in it's original box. Since the height is infinitely adjustable, I'm going to experiment with using it for an out feed surface for my table saw the rest of the year.Recommended for those who have a lot of leaves they want to compost or shred for mulch. The extra step to send leaves through this to just save trash bags when putting them to the curb for pickup probably isn't worth the effort or cost. So, judge it for your situation."

This electric leaf shredder from Sun Joe was well packaged and easy to set up and use. It's very loud! But it does a good job of making mulch out of the leaves. They are MUCH more useful to us in our garden than trash bags stuffed with dried leaves would ever be.We have four large trees in our yard and the clean up come autumn is always a handful. We can never keep up with it. But using this leaf shredder with all the leftover leaves in early winter was a dream. Here in Colorado, we're usually very dry with leaves that crunch under your feet. I'm not sure and can't say what it'd be like to use this leaf shredder with wet leaves. I used to live in Washington during college and the leaves never crunched, they were always soggy. I can say, if it works as well with wet leaves, then there is sure to be less dust than what we got.This shredder also packs away pretty nicely. Which is great since it's a once or twice a year type of thing. We're having a much better time shredding leaves, making mulch to use in our garden! If you're in the market for a leaf shredder, this one comes recommended by me."

It accomplishes in minutes what would normally take much, much longer to do by hand and although it's not particularly quiet, it's a lot less noisy than gas powered shredders tend to be and of course, there are no noxious fumes.The unit itself is fairly lightweight at 13.4 pounds so it's easy to move around when needed and since it comes apart, it doesn't take up a lot of storage space either.  I had no trouble assembling it; it's pretty intuitive and straightforward even without reading the directions.  The legs are telescopic so they can be adjusted to the height of your collection receptacle without having to resort to make-shift measures.  Shredder Joe can also be set for wet or dry leaves and for pine needles.  When you're dealing with dry leaves, you can choose between coarse, medium or fine settings as well.  It does an excellent job on the dry ones and even leaves that are damp.  Understandably, the really wet ones can present more of a problem.  Once the leaves have been processed, you can decide whether to dispose of them or use them as nutrient-rich mulch."

Sticks break the line.The plastic on this feels a bit cheaper, but not by much.  It was a little easier to assemble, mainly because I had trouble getting the stand to fit in the holes on the Flowtron. Because the legs are independent on this, there were no issues with things lining up.I like that the legs are adjustable on the Sun Joe.  I had to jerry-rig a collection container (big plastic garden tub on top of a box) with the Flowtron.  With this, I can adjust the height to fit over the tub.  Attaching a bag with the bungee cords that both units have doesn't work as well as I would have hoped.  When the bags get half-full, they tend to pull out of the elastic.  I also tried putting the Flowtron over a garbage can lined with a heavy duty garbage bag, but when the bag was full it was impossible to lift it out of the can without tearing even the heaviest-weight bag.  Shredding over a bin (which needed to be close to the bottom of the shredder or the leaves went everywhere) and dumping the bin into a bag works best for me.The good thing about the Flowtron is that the whole unit pivots on the stand.  This made it easier to remove the filled bins or bags and also to change the line.  The angle on the line on this unit has the line hitting the bottom of the frame, which seems to wear it out quicker.  I also found the line easier to install on the Flowtron, possibly because of the greater flexibility of their line (I have only used the same brands as the shredder).This is much easier to store than the Flowtron.  The top half clips into the bottom, making it very easy to remove and nest together.  The legs can be unsnapped or shortened and the whole thing put on a shelf.  The Flowtron is best left fully assembled.Basically, I prefer the Flowtron, but if the price difference is big or storage is an issue, either one would work well.  Just realize that these are weed wackers on a base and keep your expectations in line with their abilities."

I dreaded trying to get them to the front curb, so this item arrived just at the right time.The Sun Joe does exactly what it promises to do. It mulches leaves so they are easier to dispose of or use as garden mulch. It's loud, but you wouldn't expect anything else. It's very easy to use. Just attach your bag or set it over a can and turn it on.It offers multiple settings, so you can get a fine or coarse grind, depending on what you plan to do with your mulch. I prefer the finer grind since it takes up less space and should decompose quicker. There is a setting for wet leaves, but I didn't have any wet leaves to try. I should have saved some for a rainy day, but we were having so much fun that we cleaned up the yard before we realized it! I also didn't have pine needles, so I couldn't test that setting. The leaves that I did mulch seemed to be of a consistent size and it really did do a good job at it.This isn't my first experience with a product of this type. I used to have a Flowtron Leaf Eater (LE-900) and loved it, but it finally bit the dust. The Sun Joe seems to as effective than the Flowtron. I prefer the base of the LE-900 since it pivots, although the collapsible legs of the Sun Joe also has advantages. Otherwise, they are about the same.This is the type of product I would recommend to any of my friends that need or want to simplify lawn care. This seems perfect for small to medium sized yards.

This needs dry leaves slowly fed into it for it to shred them properly. It can not handle any wet leaves (and when are leaves totally dry?) nor can it handle sticks/branches of any kind.If you are looking at reducing the amount of yard waste you place at the curb, you might instead consider a vacuum/blower that shreds leaves as it goes. The power of suction will normally create a better end result and they can handle items other than dry leaves slightly better.Now if you have a composting bin/box and are looking for something to allow you to shred leaves finely for that and can take the time to sort your leaves to select dry ones without sticks, then this device will work for you. But honestly you are the exception and I am guessing that most people think they can dump leaves randomly into this and not overload it...that just isn't the case.If this had metal teeth that could handle sticks and was designed to limit the intake better so it could handle dumping large amounts in, then it would be a 5 star product--even at the higher price required. But this is sort of like a plastic toy for chopping dry leaves that you have had to hand sort.I hope this review has helped you!"

It works similarly to a grease screen to cover a pan when cooking bacon, to help prevent the pops from burning someone. The cover doesn't block every spark, but it helps contain some of the larger ones.The pit itself is sturdy and it's easy to add logs and move wood around, without worrying about bending the legs or something toppling over. It's not so extremely heavy that it's impossible to move, but it's weighty enough that it stays put once you put it somewhere.There is an included soft cover for the pit to help protect the steel from the elements when not in use. But I'd suggest eventually getting one that's a bit more heavy duty for it, since the included one can be a little difficult to put on and I could see that after some use, it will likely wear through and tear. However it's nice that one was included.Having a fire up above the ground in a pit like this seems to make for a lot more heat as well. We don't need to sit quite as close to the fire to get warm, since the pit sits up a bit and the heat radiates out really well.

The four legs are held on with allen screws and nuts, which will likely rust in a year or so and be unremovable anyway.  Sharp edges abound during assembly, so wear some protective gloves.  When assembled the legs are not all square to the frame - it looks like the plates welded to them where the screws go through are not all lined up.  The coating on the steel is a flat black paint, which may or may not hold up for a year or two.  After that, I would think it will be mostly brown with rust, especially the screen where heat will oxidize the paint off.  The thin, vinyl cover that came with it is useless -- it's too tight and the sharp corners on the legs already have torn its seams.  I just threw it out, since it's not going to keep the fire pit from rusting anyway.Is there anything I like about it?  Well, the burning area is spacious and will fit the standard 16\" split wood with room to spare.  I also like the air holes that are covered with angle iron on the bottom.  This will allow some air up through the fire and drain any water that gets in.But if you are going to spend this much money on a fire pit, I would definitely look at the copper ones by CobraCo instead.  Copper will last longer and I think is more attractive than flat black steel.  The mod I did to mine was to just drill a few 1/4\" holes in the bottom of it to let water drain and to allow some air through the fire."

        "text": "The CobraCo fire pit (FPSMISN-B) is a sturdy, attractive addition to any backyard.  It's easy to assemble, it comes with a mesh spark guard and a vinyl cover, and wood burns beautifully.Here's the low-down:1) Assembly takes about 10 minutes - all you need to do is attach the four legs to the base of the fire pit using nuts, bolts, and a hex wrench (included).  There's a small handle that needs to be attached to the center of the spark guard, but that's it.  We were up and ready to go in no time.2) Starting a fire is a cinch - I used two small strips of fire-starter (left over from the winter fireplace season), two small logs, and a whole lot of branches we gathered from the woods behind our house.  In less than a minute, we had a nice fire going, and we were able to keep it going easily for about 90 minutes.3) Fire pit stays reasonably cool during burning - in spite of the many warnings in the instructions, I didn't find that the unit got particularly hot while the fire was burning.  The legs actually stay cool (which is a good thing, since they are the things you're more likely to brush against while you're sitting around the pit), and the sides of the pit itself do get hot, but not enough to burn you.  I touched it in several places, just to check, and did not find it uncomfortably hot.4) We loved sitting around the fire - it was a gorgeous evening, and the fire was beautiful.  We spend about 90 minutes out on our patio as everything got dark around us - the fire crackled and it smelled amazing.There are a few negatives:1) It's not perfectly square - there were some small bends/imperfections in the fire pit that were somewhat noticeable, especially when the legs were attached.  This isn't a serious problem (and it in no way affected the usability of the fire pit), but this is a fairly expensive item, and I expected it to look better.2) The spark guard doesn't fit very well - in fact, it's difficult to get the thing to sit squarely on the fire pit.  This is less of a problem in daylight, or when there's no fire in the pit, but we had a bit of a problem getting the screen to sit properly on the pit once the sun had set and the fire was going.3) The spark guard doesn't really prevent sparks from flying - we noticed almost as many sparks rising with the spark guard on as we did without it.  Since we had our fire pit on a concrete patio quite a distance from our house (or any other flammable area), it wasn't a problem for us.  We actually used the pit without the fire guard for most of the evening.  But if you're planning to use this closer to a deck or house, just be aware that the spark guard isn't a guarantee that sparks won't escape.Bottom line, this is a very nice feature to our backyard, and I have no doubt we will use it many, many times.  As the instructions state, please don't use this on a wooden deck or anywhere near your house.  It's best placed on concrete or dirt so you can relax and not worry about what the sparks might ignite.  Please check out the pictures I've posted, which should give you a good idea of how this fire pit works.  I do recommend it."

I did not need to wear protective gloves, but being aware there may be rough spots, for me, prevented possible cuts.When I checked, the live chat on the manufacturer's website was not operational so I phoned the adventgarddendecor customer service department to find out if they could replace missing or damaged screws, bolts, washers and brackets since that sometimes happens, and it was not addressed in the FAQ area of their website. The answer is yes, just call or email them but if the unit is purchased through Amazon, rather than their website, they will ask for a copy of the Amazon receipt.The fire pit is reasonably sturdy and since it is powder coated, should resist rusting although from experience, when not in use, I will take pains to keep it sheltered from the elements. I appreciate the included cover but am already thinking about its replacement. The vinyl is pretty thin and it only has a simple elastic enclosed bottom hem to keep it in place. I am not sure it will stay on securely with even a moderate amount of wind. If the cover had hook and loop (Velcro) straps that wrapped around the legs it might be more secure, although with flimsy vinyl, the straps sometimes tear off.The Mission style design is handsome and basic enough that it should work well with a number of different architectural styles. The instructions have the usual, but important warnings about keeping the fire pit away from not just combustible surfaces (house siding included) and off of wood decks, but also suggests keeping sand, water and/or fire extinguisher nearby. It was also suggested, and I complied, that a one inch layer of sand be placed in the base of the pit to serve as insulation to protect the bottom from extreme heat.A handy long handled hook is included to lift and remove the heated spark guard (top) from the base, although it feels a little flimsy so keeping a fire resistant mitt nearby might be a good idea. Wood, charcoal and self-starting logs can all be burned in the pit but for the cleanest burn, use hardwood.  Using cold water to extinguish the fire may stress the metal and shorten its life, so sand might be a better option. With my last fire pit, I promptly used a wire brush on any areas of rust that appeared and then touched-up the areas with high temperature paint. A little maintenance went a long way.What I like about this fire pit is that the metal mesh used on the base and spark guard is quite fine so it should keep most embers and sparks within its framework. My previous fire pit had mesh with much larger holes. This appears to be a much safer fire pit. I am impressed with the appearance and construction although the lifting tool and vinyl cover are flimsy. I will update the review as I continue to use the fire pit."

        "text": "There are a couple of stand out things to like about this fire pit. For one, my other half had it assembled in less time than it took me to place fire resistant pavers on the deck. For another, compared to our (old, broken, ceramic) chimenea, this pit holds more wood and burns much hotter.We kicked off our summer with a bbq with visiting relatives and some neighbors. The firepit was prepared in advance and before evening fully turned to night we lit it and pulled chairs close. Once the fire was going (we may have overdone it as there was some serious popping going on) I was thankful for the efficiency of the cover.Given that it is metal, and the size of the flames, it was no surprise that it got hot. Really, really hot. Children, dogs and a couple of unsteady adults were kept under constant supervision anytime they were in the vicinity.I have only a couple of small criticisms. Neither would keep me from purchasing this fire pit. The first is it feels a little lightweight, given the picture and price. Second, the cover is a throwaway. I will either have to purchase a substitute cover or resolve to lug the fire pit to the garage.We have enjoyed our CobraCo Steel Mission Fire Pit at least once every weekend since its assembly and look forward to many more summer nights around the fire."

I used a piece of duct tape on the inside of the cover to  cover the hole which was about an inch long.Price wise I think it iss over priced.  I did some price checking at the local  Home Improvement Stores and you can purchase a comparable fire pit for about half the cost of this one.  I have found with previous fire pits if you keep it up off the ground a few inches and keep it covered they will last much longer."

        "text": "This is the first paint sprayer system I've owned, so this review is coming from the perspective of a novice.First, I found the system very easy to assemble. The instructions were very clear, and I had no problem understanding how to put the system together and use it. I did have a bit of problem mastering the technique of paint spraying, and I don't think I fully have it yet, but I'm sure that will come in time. I tended to want to hold the sprayer a bit closer to the surface of the object I was spraying (in this case some shutters and trim on the outside of my garage) than was advised in the instructions, which resulted in the paint being sprayed a bit more thickly than I wanted. Again, that's my fault and not the sprayer. The instructions, as I said were very clear as to how to use the sprayer. Also, even though I was warned by a few people that there would be a lot of overspray, I didn't mask the non-painted areas off as well as I probably should have. The Flexio is pretty accurate as far as where the paint goes, but there is still a fair amount of overspray, so I will be more careful next time.Cleanup was easy, although there are a lot of little parts that need to be disassembled. Again, great instructions from Wagner, so I wasn't afraid to completely break the Flexio down to clean it. I was happy that Wagner also included a small brush to use to help clean away all the paint from the unit. Once it was disassembled and flushed/brushed out, the whole unit came away very clean, and it was easy to put it back together again.As a novice to paint sprayers, I was very pleased with the Flexio 590, and I can honestly say that it is a great product, and easy to operate, even for someone with little to no experience. I can't wait to tackle more paint jobs with it!"

        "text": "When it comes to interior projects, I prefer a roller/brush for walls and ceilings.  For pieces of furniture or other items which I can paint outside, I usually want to use a spray can.  So for this latter group of work, I decided to get Wagner&#8217;s Flexio 590.  While this sprayer is really good at minimizing overspray, in general when you spray paint into the air you end up with mist or overspray, no matter how careful you are.  I must say, if you do want to use a sprayer inside, this one is great at keeping residue to a bare minimum.What&#8217;s in the box?&#8226; The 590 spray gun&#8226; iSpray nozzle/canister&#8226; Detail nozzle/canister&#8226; User Guide&#8226; Carrying caseSet up is simple, and everything connects together easily.  This sprayer can be used to apply unthinned &#8220;residential&#8221; paints.  It also can handle just about any other paint product.  You can change the sprayer and flow settings to apply latex and oil-based paints, stains, sealers, and polyurethene.  I have used it on Benjamin Moore satin paint as well as an outdoor deck stain I use (Wolman semi-transparent- Cedar color).While I don&#8217;t think the deck stain came out any better than when I brushed it on, it certainly came out no worse, and I was done in less than half the time.  I used the iSpray nozzle for the bulk of the deck floor, then used the Detail nozzle for the balusters, railings, and areas close to my house siding, etc.  I am usually outside a whole day staining the deck.  Thanks to the Flexio, I was done in only a 2-3 of hours, including protecting areas from overspray.The paints I have used, such as the BJ Regal satin, went on flawlessly when applied to drywall.The nozzle settings allow you to modify the width of what you spray, the paint flow and, using the X-Boost dial, you can adjust the airflow.This sprayer works very well.  Keeping it clean is key, and the manual covers that, with instructions on cleaning the nozzle and flushing the unit.  I think any painting tool needs to be properly cleaned, even a brush, or you can ruin it &#8211; the Flexio 590 is no exception.  But cleanup is pretty simple as all the parts requiring cleaning can be easily disassembled and washed.I also refinished a metal lamppost on my front lawn using a thick, oil based paint (Rustoleum) and it worked great.  I did need to clean off the nozzle a few times, but if you&#8217;ve used this paint in a can, it can be thick.  I did not thin the Rustoleum and it was fine, but a lamppost is a small job.  For a large area, you may need to test and decide if you need to thin it.  But for what I did, the Wagner sprayed the paint on just fine, unmixed.Wagner backs this product with a 1 year warranty.I will update this review if I run into any problems with the sprayer, or other performance notes.  But for now, this thing is a clear winner."

For outside use we had to use an extension cord as we only have two outlets, one front and one back, and were painting the fascia. However, not having to have our arms over our head and climb up and down stools to paint overhead was fabulous.This also worked great on some bathroom cabinets we refaced and painted. Smooth, with no brush lines. For the finishing I found the smaller detail sprayer to be a bit finicky and preferred just cutting in with a small corner brush. However, this is an excellent choice for any large projects, it covers smoothly and quickly and is great for those hard to reach overhead projects."

        "text": "Painting the house or a room is normally just a royal pain in the &#34;fill in the blank&#34;This just makes life so much easier.I was surprised at how nice it would be to be able to just spend a little extra time taping things off and putting down some drop cloths and spraying away.You can even do a ceiling as long as you remember to turn the pick up tube to the rear of the paint tank. so when you tip it up it wont be sucking air instead of paint. Just remember to put the fan flat and use a front to back motion instead of side to side to keep an even coat of paint with each pass. Don't tip it past 45degrees though as it does mention in the instructions that paint could flow the wrong way if you do. I had no problem the entire time I use this to paint a ceiling in the house. Tipping it forward isn't as much of an issue, just keep in mind that you need to keep the pickup tube in the paint though.I found the ability to swap on the fly the spray width of the larger tank is quite handy when getting to windows and other items you want to get nice clean coverage around.The smaller detail tank works wonders for getting smaller jobs done and allowed me to get everything I needed done without issue.My brother has had the smaller cheaper units of these Wagner painters and always had issues with them. I've already used this model on several jobs over the last couple weeks and it has just proven to be a work horse. It just keeps spraying and the best part is I didn't have to buy all kinds of different brushes, rollers and so. Just tape... I'd rather spend a longer time taping things off than having to mess with brushes and rollers. I was able to do an 8 foot high by 13 foot wall inside of 10 minutes or less. I probably should have kept track of that a little better but it just went so fast. Granted that was for each coat but normally that big of a wall would have taken 3 times that amount of time with a roller and splattered paint everywhere. I didn't have much go any farther than a few inches from the base of the wall and so much more was actually on the wall instead of wasted in a roller, the pan and on the floor from flinging off the wall.Playing with the power will give you different effects in how the paint looks in the end for texture.If you want to really make things go fast you want to kind of treat the spray gun like an automotive paint gun works. pull the trigger just a little bit to initiate the turbine, once it's spooled up then pull the trigger the rest of the way to initiate the paint spray. At the end of each pass only let up so that the paint spray stops but the turbine keeps going. Doing this will make keep your passes consistent and even. Much like is done in the automotive industry.So spend the extra cash on a better sprayer and paint to your hearts content... I've had no issues so far with this unit."

I followed another reviews advice, and practiced using the sprayers outside using just water. Being that I never used a paint sprayer before, I wanted to practice and get used to it. After taping up the area, and laying down a tarp, I used the larger sprayer to do the hallway. I can't believe how easy it was to do. Just like another reviewer said, the hardest part was the prep work, because the paint sprayer was very easy. I did notice that I had to go over a few spots, but that was probably my fault for not spraying close enough to the wall. My hallway looks great now, and now I'm thinking of doing the dining room too!"

        "text": "While I was hoping to use this on multiple projects prior to reviewing, the weather has prevented the outdoor painting projects to get started...  So with that said, I've used this for painting interior walls, using thick, not-thinned, latex paint.  And for me, it did much better than expected.The paint went on with very even coverage as long as you just sweep the sprayer back and forth.  As opposed to hand painting, the amount of paint used versus the amount of paint needed is significant - I used maybe half of what I had used prior with a paintbrush.  Granted, the coat of paint is much thinner, but that's also a good thing - it dried much faster, and if needed, I can apply another coat.  (So far, I don't see any reason to apply another coat.)The setup of this was easy - just add some paint, screw on the sprayer you want to use (small one for detailing jobs, big one for big jobs), and have at it.  You can change the amount of paint being sprayed as well as the force that the turbine blows the paint out (which, for latex paint, needs to stay at one of the more powerful settings.)All in all, this is a great painting system, and for the admittedly limited number of painting projects I've been able to use it on so far, I'd recommend it highly.  If you're painting more than a few walls, you'll probably get a return on investment for this system since you'll be using much less paint (and it goes a lot faster than manually painting, too!)  Great product!"

        "text": "Wagner's Flexio 590 Hand-held Paint Sprayer is very easy to assemble and use.  Comes with power motor and two nozzle attachments.  The larger one and half quart will spray larger surfaces and doesn't require diluting the paint.  The smaller bottle has a detail finisher nozzle for fine spraying projects and depending on the paint will probably needs some diluting.  Adjustments are fairly simple and easy to use.  One of the best ways to practice using this sprayer is to go outside and just use water in the sprayer and play with the adjustments without any paint worries or cleanup.  That way you can see just how this sprayer works.  This is the perfect product to paint the fence. This is one area where overspray is not really much of a problem.  The hardest part of using the sprayer is the taping and prep work required for each project.  Also cleanup is still the major part of any painting project.  Latex paints can be cleaned with soap and water.  Oil base paints will require mineral spirits and possible soaking of spray nozzles.  That is the one area where I can see a problem developing and that is with clogged spray nozzles.  Keeping these clear and spraying free is going to be the challenge with this and any other sprayer.  I would highly recommend this sprayer for doing any outside project like painting the fence or deck.  Well worth getting for speeding those painting projects along."

My husband doesn't have a DIY bone in his body, and I'm too thrifty (ok cheap) to pay someone to do something I can do myself... even if it's something I pretty much hate. Yes, I admit it... I hate painting. However I also like freshly painted walls and change my decorating tastes frequently, so I've painted every room in each of our last 3 houses at least once, usually a couple times each. I've spilled a full gallon of paint on the carpet (thank goodness for owning carpet cleaners), I've ruined paint brushes by not washing them well enough, wasted lots of money on rollers because the thought of even trying to wash them was too daunting after being exhausted from painting rooms, I've cursed and complained and yet still continued to paint those walls.After trying this sprayer once all I thought to myself is \" YOU IDIOT!!!! WHY DIDN'T YOU GET ONE OF THESE YEARS AGO??? \", I did try another sprayer once... I believe it was a B&D; that was passed on to me from my stepdad... it was horrible, you had to thin out your paint, it clogged every 5 seconds, it was worse to wash out that 100 thick napped roller covers, I think I threw it away.... well if you've had an experience like that in the past don't let it cloud your sunny future with this sprayer. It's nothing like that.The directions are detailed and clear, parts are easy to figure out and put together. The longest part of the painting process is your prep, do a really good job with this since it's easier to keep paint off something than it is to remove it from something. I do recommend doing some tests before starting on your actual project so you get a feel for how the sprayer works, the different ways you can spray, etc.It's winter here now so I'm only able to use this indoors but for once I can't wait for the warmer weather so we can refinish our deck (a task I had been dreading when It hought I'd have to do each spindle by hand), I expect it to go so much faster and easier now... and I have some furniture I was thinking I'd have to use cans of spray paint to refinish that I now play to use this sprayer for instead!Buy one, you won't regret it!"

But after using this Wagner sprayer, I'm a convert. Using a sprayer is much faster and results in a more professional looking paint job that is smooth without brush/roller marks. Of course, there is a bit of a learning curve, so it's great that Wagner provides test boards so you can get used to the sprayer.Having a wide sprayer and detail sprayer, with their own canisters gives a lot of flexibility on the types of projects you can tackle with this thing. The wide sprayer works great with straight up paint, but the detail sprayer needs the paint to be thin down quite a bit in order to spray it. With both nozzles, you still need to mask the areas you don't want painted. Even though there isn't much overspray, you will get paint where you don't want it to be, specially little specks of it. The Wagner allows you to control how much paint is sprayed and the speed of the turbine for more precise control.My only issue is that it does feel a bit heavy and tired my arms frequently. But it's still amazing how much more wall I can paint in the same amount of time vs using a roller."

He was able to paint the siding on the addition in a little over an hour and it looks pretty good. We also used this in our kitchen to paint our old brown cabinet facings white. It works good, but obvioulsy you want to make sure you have your floor and other surfaces protected, there was a bit of drippage with this product, but it still took an otherwise all day project and we completed it in a fraction of the time. The nozzle got clogged once, only because used old paint. We are scheduled to use this sprayer to paint our deck. The list price on this product is $282, but the Amazon price is $147. Even had we paid the list price, the sprayer paid for itself when we used it for the siding and the kitchen cabinets. A contractor wanted to charge us $1500 for the siding and $800 for the cabinets.

If you aren't willing to take time to do either one of these (which let's admit, are no one's favorite parts of painting), then perhaps sticking to the ol' roller and brush might be a better option. However, we chose to use this sprayer for shutters and a table that needed refinishing. Both came out lovely, professional looking and were done quickly.This is a nice sprayer with both general and detail paint sprayer heads. I like that it is light weight and not very loud. My husband appreciated that there was no need to dilute paint because it is pretty powerful and it holds quite a bit.Although time consuming, clean up is simple. REMEMBER: you should disassemble the nozzle. I can see this being great for painting fences and lattice, too. Wonderful for items that would shred a brush or roller and have a lot of edges.

This Wagner Flexio 590 Indoor/Outdoor Hand Held Sprayer System will give me the professional smooth finishes I need in my painting in way, way less time. This system comes with the X-Boost Turbine handle, the iSpray nozzle, the detail finish nozzle, 2 filters in the Turbine handle, 2 funnels, a practice spray poster, thinning accessory, a carrying case to hold everything in and the owner's manual.  The directions are extremely thorough and after reading everything and practicing using this sprayer's 2 different nozzles, you will be so pleased with the perfect professional results, you will not want to use a brush or roller ever again.As with all paint jobs, prep work is everything, and it is no different with a hand held sprayer. You want to clean whatever it is you are painting first and mask the border. I found the overspray to be minimal with this sprayer, but masking is still needed. Once you are ready for painting, just be sure you do a couple of practice sprays first, to get the feel of the sprayer and to see how keeping the handle straight and steady with even sweeping motions will keep the sprayer from spitting or spraying too thin or thick. You'll see that moving constantly and distance is everything also. When you first use the practice poster with the iSpray nozzle, you will see that you will be 6-12 inches away to get a spray of 10 to 12 inches wide. Then when you practice with the detail finish nozzle, you'll find you'll spray 1 to 6 inches away for a spray 1/2 inch to 3 inches wide. Steady, straight sweeping motions will give you perfect results.Once you mix the material you will be using, you will want to adjust the controls by setting your air power and material flow control. The materials you use with the iSpray nozzle can be from thin sealers to medium polyurethanes to heavy latex paints or primers. The incredible thing about this iSpray nozzle is that you don't have to thin the materials with water. You can thin them if you like, as it will mean cleaning the nozzle hole less while painting, but I found that when I sprayed constantly and steadily for a while the sprayer didn't clog or spit until I stopped to rest my arm and began again. At this point I simply unclogged the sprayer hole with the thinning accessory, did a practice spray and went back to spraying again. The thinning accessory tells you how much water to add to the container to thin your paint or material besides having a tip to keep the nozzle hole clean.As for the detail finish nozzle, this sprayer hole is so tiny, you absolutely have to thin your material no matter what you are using to paint or stain with. Thinning is a must for this detail nozzle and you will be impressed with the perfect results you will get. For both nozzles, you can adjust the spray shape, but you can only adjust the spray width on the iShape nozzle.The owner's manual also covers proper spraying techniques for both wide and detailed spraying. I find that simply practicing will give you all you need in learning distance and adjustments to get the results you need. When finished painting, cleanup is unbelievably easy. You basically want to flush the unit with water half full for water based materials or one quarter full of mineral spirits for oil based materials. After flushing, you just take the nozzle apart and I just let it soak in a bucket of soapy water. Then take a soft brush to it, dry and remember to use vaseline on the O ring before putting it back together again. The reassembly of the nozzle is pictured in the manual, so you don't have any worries after it's apart in pieces. The only maintenance you'll have is cleaning the 2 filters and cleaning the air valve tube on the iSpray nozzle.Painting is a huge job, with lots of prep work and cleanup time, so anything that cuts down on the actual time spent painting is a huge plus for me and this Wagner sprayer makes it so much easier with it's super fast wide and detailed sprayers, which can be mastered with just a little practice. Walls, baseboards, trims, ceilings, fences, house siding, furniture, decks and even crafts turn out with a beautiful professional smooth finish when spraying with this great sprayer system and it is definitely a 4 1/2 Star time saver."

        "text": "The Q2200 description states that it is fully assembled.When I requested this grill (the Q 2200) though Vine, I was especially excited that it stated it was FULLY ASSEMBLED. When it arrived I discovered the truth - it is &#34;generally assembled&#34; but has some parts that need to be assembled, and I don't just mean sliding things in place.The lid is held on by pegs with cotter pins, (not too bad, except one hole wasn't fully drilled and I had to pound it through on one side). The front handle must be assembled (3 parts) with screws using a Philips head screwdriver. the control pops on, as does the ignition button. Of course, you need to slide the drip collector (with disposable aluminum holder) on, and put in the extra heavy (most of the 45 pounds) grate in place.The heavy weight grill impressed me, and the sides flip up and fold under for carrying or protection from the elements. Best of all, it uses EITHER size of the small disposable propane cylinders! No worry about finding the correct size. You can buy an adapter and hook this up to a large refillable propane tank if you would like.I enjoy having the small size (I buy 16 oz tanks) so that it is even more portable and perfect for a tailgating party. It also allows me to keep several extras on hand. I use them for both my grill and my &#34;emergency&#34; stove in case of power outage.This lights easily and has a high lid for a roast (or small turkey). Having come from California, I love being able to BBQ a turkey on my grill. The wide handle makes it easy to control the flame, and the thermometer in the lid makes it easy to monitor the temperature during your cooking.It is much more portable than my larger grill and yet is large enough to cook meals for the four of us without trouble. Everything (except the weight of the grate) makes this easy to handle and carry, and the heavier grate means nicely seared steaks.IF this had been described correctly (partially assembled) I would have given it five stars. I am giving it four, because I think it is important to catch buyer's attention and let them know to expect a bit of assembly, not because it is a less than five star product."

It has been 100% reliable, cooks great, it's easy to move in and out of the garage, all around awesome.I was excited to get this grill and try the latest and greatest, this grill has not disappointed.  It arrives in a very large box, you'll need 2 people to move it.  Assembly was straight forward, and everything went together easily.I've used it a couple of times, it's been cold since I received it, so it will be getting much more use when the weather improves.The grill started easily, I pre-heat for 10 minutes or so before adding food.  I've cooked steaks and chicken on it so far.  It cooks easily,  and uniformly, and tastes great.  Make sure you use the drip pan to avoid a mess.  They don't need to be replaced very often, and are easy to find online or at box stores.It's roomy enough to cook steaks or chicken breasts ( the big Costco ones) for about 4 people.  If you are grilling hamburgers or hot dogs, it can certainly entertain more people.All in all another great grill from Weber.  They cook great, are compact, and reliable."

        "text": "I previously owned the much older version the Weber Q200 for almost 10 years now and it was about time for a replacement. It has a new improved look! The biggest differences I can tell is the grate now comes in TWO pieces and heating controls are redesigned.  The Weber Q2000 looks more sleek and rounder.Time has also taken a toll on the appearance on my old Q200. Also I have had to replace the burner once and the ignition part that sparks inside the grill when the push button ignition is pushed. Those are parts that over the years get coated with juices from the meats you cook and also rust over with time. I also once replaced the gas regulator. The replacement arts are very inexpensive. I was able to get the ignition part and gas regulator directly from Weber and purchased the burner on Amazon.  So just remember when it comes to replacement parts, Amazon and Weber are great options to get them at reasonable prices.I already possess the grill standWeber 6549 Weber Q Rolling Cartand cover which will work with the Q2000. It typically sits on my deck with a 20lb propane tank. The grill is perfect to take along on fishing and camping trips and use portable small 16 ounce propane tanks. The grill's cast iron porcelain-enameled grates will last forever. They heat up quickly and cook evenly. Another great accessory is the Griddle insert for making scramble eggs and breakfast. I highly recommend investing in a wire brush to keep the burner holes clean from food and burnt in grease.I like to use a cover on the grill because it sits out in the open on my deck. If you don't have a cover on it, the drip trays will fill up with water and spill over on days it rains because of the rounded shape of the grill. The drip trays are great since they are just aluminum trays that are removable and you just throw them away. However they are not easy to find. Amazon is the only place I have been able to find them, not even retail hardware chain stores carry them in our area. Here is the link to the drip trays:Weber 6415 Small 7-1/2-Inch-by-5-inch Aluminum Drip Pans, Set of 10Overall I love my Weber Grill and I would prefer this type of grill to those big stainless steel types."

        "text": "Already owning a weber genesis I was excited to take a look at the Q series &#34;portable&#34; line of Weber grills. The 3200 model is the premier model in the line of 5 Q series grills, with all the others being a &#34;Tabletop&#34; version. The 3200 is similar to the 2000 versions however it comes with a stand. At first I was a little disappointed that this was plastic. Being used to the build quality of the Genesis series I was surprised.... however it quickly became apparent that my concerns were not warranted and this is a smart design choice by Weber. The use of a heavy duty plastic results in a dramatic reduction in weight without a loss of it feeling solid. I was able to put the unit together in under an hour without any assistance. The documentation is clear and the instructions guided me through to completion without issue. The grill is well designed, as with all Weber grills I have owned or used, the attention to detail shows the quality of this grill. The built in handle light is a nice addition which I had purchased for the genesis, this comes included with the 3200. The side tables fold down and click back together with a substantial lock. The design of the grill plate is clever, the cast porcelain coated plates actually incorporate a flavorizer bar just below the grill bars allowing for a much more compact unit without sacrificing the key functions of the bigger grills in the Weber family.The lid is aluminum coated to reduce the weight of the unit, which can easily be lifted by two people without any strain (one could do it in a pinch). I was able to roll this around with one hand. Ideal for throwing on a truck for tailgating before the game and with the tables folding down the footprint for transporting is not too big. Weber's standard drip tray is also incorporated with the unit meaning standard parts can be purchased for use. There is incorporated holder for the propane tank - electric ignition and dual burners - one outside ring and a central burner from left to right this allows for configuration of indirect heat if required.Again you are getting Weber's quality and from my understanding their warranty service is outstanding - I have never had to utilize it though, their products have served me that well in the past. Due to the winter weather this has seen very limited use but as soon as it warms up a bit I look forward to lighting this baby up some more!"

        "text": "I have had Webers before and they are my grill of choice. They distinguish themselves with the best grills I have ever encountered: nice heavy porcelain cast iron. The grills heat evenly and provide great results.I have only had propane Webers before. So I was very intrigued about how an electric grill would work and the results. Well the results are fantastic. The body is very well engineered. It provides a nice seal which essentially makes the grill a convection oven. The taste is very 'clean'. but you still get grill flavor. But your seasoning and the nice quick sear is what is giving you flavor. There is no slight gas flavor, which is a plus to me.Steaks have come out heavenly. But bone-in chicken, wow. Moist, crisp, tender, juicy. I put it perhaps a little past medium high as recommended for the chicken but it came out great. The steaks were on high and so juicy.There are a couple of limitations to be aware of. There is a suggested 20 minute warm up time before you put food down. I have followed this. Certainly for steaks on high you want the grill to be nice and warm. But you should be aware of that before ordering if that is a concern. Second there is 'only' a 6 foot cord and they suggest you don't use an extension cord. This is a problem for us and I would suspect for others. We can reach an outlet from a table, but it is stretched across off the ground. Not good if you have little kids. Of course if you buy a cart this is not a problem.One other small suggestion. Put the handle on before you attach the cover in back to the main body. It was awkward to attach the handle after the top was connected. But overall very little assembly.Even with the small issues this was easily a 5. I am finding myself not wanting to use my other grills. If you are in a situation without having access to propane or charcoal, bam this guy will have you grilling as well as anyone else. But even without having any limitations, I really like the easy temp control and not having to buy propane this grill affords. And the results are delicious."

        "text": "Probably like a lot of folks, I used to own a different brand grill and often wondered \"What's the big deal about Weber?\" and assumed it was just marketing for some sort of adequate, but overpriced, grill.  Then years ago I replaced my old grill with a Weber Genesis....and I never looked back.  The quality was great.  So when the need arose for a portable grill, I didn't look much further than Weber.I actually have the Q1200 and the Q2000.I do not do a lot of camping or tailgating, but I like to have this available for the occasional \"picnic type\" BBQ, like on a short trip down the shore.I have also used it for a party at home, when I wanted to have some auxiliary grill space.  I find it extremely useful when I am grilling something that might cook faster than what's on my main grill, and/or takes up less space (hot dogs, grilled veggies, etc.).Someone who has an apartment, but maybe not a lot of patio or deck space might enjoy this type of grill as well.So, what's in the box?  The grill, already assembled, except for the handle!  Set up took less than 15 minutes, some of which was cutting open the box.Whereas my larger Weber grill has three straight burners which ruin across the length of the grill, both the Q1200 and Q2000 have a rectangular burner.  Lighting is a breeze, with your basic piezo spark starter, and heat distribution is very good.  You can adjust the heat, low, medium, and high, like full-size Webers, but since these have one burner, you need to reposition meat to sear it, etc. as opposed to lowering/raising, or turning off one burner.While portable, the Q2000 is still a decent size for cooking.  Fully open it's about 51\" wide (including the tables), about 26\" high and about 2 feet deep.  The cooking surface is about 280 square inches.The Q1200 is a little smaller at just under 41\" wide (again, with the tables extended), about 24 \" high, and 20 \" deep. The Q1200 has 189 square inches of cooking surface.  In cooking terms that's about 7 or 8 hamburger patties for the Q1200 versus 10 or 11 patties on the Q2000.  The Q2000 is 12,000 BTUs, while the Q1200 is 8,500 BTUs.The grill surface consists of two cast iron grills, which is a smaller, but similar design to Weber full-size grills.  They are porcelain enameled.You have to place the grill on a raised surface like a table, as it does not come with a raised stand.  The built in stand keeps it just a few inches off a surface.  Weber does sell an optional raised stand.  The built in stand also has two folding tables on it, which come in handy for keeping food, condiments, plates, etc. on them.The Q series grills are fueled by 14.1 or 16.4 ounce LP canisters.  Like a raised stand, you can buy an optional adapter so you can connect a full-size propane tank.I have seen other reviews which say the Q2000 does not have a grease drip tray.  Both my grills include one.  They have a removable metal drip pan.  My box also included one disposable aluminum tray.  I recommend these on any grill, as it makes it easy to throw these out and replace them, rather than clean the more permanent drip pan.On my wish list would be a built in thermometer for all Q series grills.  While I have meat thermometers (stand-alone and built into meat forks), I like a built-in one just to show me general heat ranges.  Some Q series grills have a thermometer (Q1200 & Q2200) built in (150 to 600 degrees).Overall, this is a great portable grill.  Whether your use is camping, tail-gating, at home, etc.  the Q Series grills are a great value.  Weber backs it with a 2 year overall warranty, as well as 5 years on the cookbox, grates, lid, burners and plastic surfaces.  Basically it's a 5 year warranty, but 2 years on paint, etc."

        "text": "This Review is for the Weber Q 2400 Electric Grill.Webers are just great grills no matter which one you decide on. The Q series are just neat little grills that are so versatile. I have a huge mega burner rotisserie stainless thing that just sits there now that I have used a Weber Q. They are just simple and don't require a whole lot of anything to use and clean. Plus you can move them all over easily since they weigh so little.I have, and still use, a Weber Q series propane grill model 230 that has a taller grill lid in case I want to do a turkey. Thought at the time I would do some turkeys two years ago, so far haven't grilled a big bird. List of things to do I guess.The downside to the propane other than keeping tabs on the amount of fuel in the tank so you don't run out half way through is that the regulators are very temperamental and you never know how long it will take you to get it started. The safety feature shuts off the main valve if it is hit with full force gas, like turning the tank valve on. It can take up to five minutes later for the safety valve to stand down and let it flow. So yeah thats a pain, and it does not always do it so you have the excitement of never knowing if it will ignite now or later.The electric is a great model. The only downside I have found is that it has no temperature gauge like the propane. That seems just stupid, as a gauge is really necessary on grills for proper cooking unless you like everything rare or burnt. Ok maybe thats an exaggeration but it is helpful to know the cooking temp.The electric is easier in most ways than the propane to operate, and cook with. Either way you are not going to go wrong thats for sure. Like the propane it has two grates that can easily be cleaned, and this model of the electric has two heating elements.Here are the official specs on this model and this model only.

        "text": "This is our first propane grill. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of the way charcoal flavors food, but now that we have a toddler who loves being outside, so we have happily traded the taste of charcoal for the convenience of propane.The Grill came in a surprising number of pieces. There was a lot more assembly required then I would have thought. It took my husband a little over an hours to unpack, assemble and dispose of the packaging. So, it was pretty quick. He said the installation was easy and intuitive with good instructions. Now, my husband tends to by very good at putting things together. The installation may take a little longer for most folks.The grill itself was easy to use and did a wonderful job of cooking, although cooking with propane is a little different than cooking with charcoal. (I&#8217;m sure many of you are rolling your eyes and thinking &#8220;DUH&#8221; right now&#8230;.)I have two criticisms about this grill. The first is that the side tables snap up and down, and they are very difficult and latch. This may get easier as they become more worn, but ultimately they feel kind of cheap on what is an otherwise well-made and gorgeous grill. The other criticism is very slight, but the drip pan is a disposable aluminum tray. I wish they would have made a little more effort here and given something a little more sturdy.Overall, we are thus far thrilled with this grill. Everything we have cooked so far has been great and I&#8217;m finding that I don&#8217;t miss the charcoal flavor as much as I thought I would. My husband is finding that he doesn&#8217;t miss the mess associated with charcoal at all!"

        "text": "Weber has always made their portable grills built to standards that will ensure frustration free usage and long life.  They haven't failed here with the Q1000 model.  The unit gets plenty hot and is built like a tank.First off, understand that you aren't getting a stand with this unit. You can buy one separately or just use an existing table, or even just place it on concrete if you don't mind bending down to cook, like an old hibachi. The unit uses those little propane cans that are cheapest to purchase at places such as Flowes or Home Desposts. Avoid getting them at supermarkets where the markup can be 3-5x as much for desperate shoppers.There's plenty of heat for cooking frozen chicken, which is usually the toughest thing to cook properly on a portable grill.  However, what I enjoy most is the through the purchase of the griddle unit.  You have to buy it separately but with that, you can easily cook bacon, sausages, eggs, and anything else for breakfast.  I really enjoy this because breakfast is my preferred meal of the day, and the outdoors doesn't get too hot in the early morning.No cons with this unit, except it's so well regarded that it becomes a theft magnet so make sure to cover it up out of sight because even thieves know how great this unit is !"

I live in an apartment with a small patio and love to bbq with this Weber grill. I used to have a q200 and it was great until I gave it away. The only differences I noticed between my old one and this one is the temperature gauge. It is nice to know when your grill is nice and hot and read to cook on. Also, the grate on my old one was one piece and this new one is a 2 piece. Makes it a lot easier to remove and clean when necessary. The grill arrives pretty much ready to use except for the handle. I purchased the adapter to use my own propane tank since I was going through the disposables real quick. I keep the disposables for emergencies in case I run out. I also purchased a 5lb tank to take to bbq's at the park. The disposables were to expensive and the 20lb was too big. The igniter is great but I just use a long nose lighter instead. It is much quicker and easier since the igniter doesn't work as good as in the beginning. A real great grill that will last many many seasons."

We had a smaller one for many years and it worked well for us but was smaller than this one. I feel the 2200 would be a good size for 2-6 people, there was room for about 10 burgers plus a pack of hotdogs without being squished too much. Get the propane attachment so you can put a big bottle on it which lasts a long time and is much cheaper than those little portable tanks. I am getting a stand for this too. It is a bit heavy (40lbs) for me to lug around much and because of the size it is a little clumsy to carry also. It seems well made and should last for many years. The burner will need to be cleaned at some point because of the grease and stuff that falls down there but you would have that with almost any grill.I would recommend this grill, it cooks good and is fairly easy to clean."

So when Weber grills appeared in my monthly Vine newsletter, I jumped at the opportunity without any hesitation, luckily I got both the Q1200 and Q2200 models. After a few times of trying them out and comparing them side by side, I have to say I am very impressed by the quality of these grills. Both require minimum amount of assembly, they are somewhat compact,  easy to transport, heats up very fast, easy to control, most importantly, unlike my Weber charcoal grill, much less clean-up. From what I can tell, these two models are very much the same except a couple of minor differences:1. The Q1200 has a burner that produces 8,500 btu per hour, whereas it's 12,000 btu for the Q2200.2. The Q2200 has a larger cooking area than the Q1200, 280 square inches vs 189 square inches."

The small one got used often as I mostly cooked for two at home. In my opinion, Weber couldnot do any better in term of design if they want to.If you are used to the charcoal flavor and extreme heat that could sear your steak in seconds, this grill is not for you. At high heat, it will quickly brown your steak and does a decent job of keeping the juice inside. Whether charcoal or gas, you still need a meat thermometer to make sure the right temperture is reached. If your steak is 1/2&#34; thick or less, this gril may cook it to welldone before you can see some browning on the outside due to lower heat (than charcoal). I believe this grill is great for cooking chicken and turkey, as you will need lower heat and extended time.The grill comes almost fully assembled. I only need to attach the handles. I have the tank adapter from another grill, so start cooking with a full tank. No built-in thermometer and drip tray, so that was the reason for 4 stars. You always have to remember to put a drip tray under the grill when cooking, otherwise you have a mess. Most built-in thermometers are inaccurate anyway, but it let you know when your grill reaches the heat level you need.This Weber grill is a great buy. Great looking and design, compact enough for the back of my SUV, perfect for a small patio. I will enjoy this grill for a long time to come."

Burners crack and break, the housing rusts through, etc.I have had an older model of the weber Q grill for the past 3 years, it has sat on my deck with a weber cover over it and yes looks great still.I actually got two different weber grills, both reviews are below.--------So now the review for this smaller portable version of the grill. It is made very similar to the larger model except it's about 1/3 the size. The lid is constructed out of the same material, the grates are heavy duty and everything about this grill is just smaller then the larger model.The build quality is excellent. When taking the portable grill out of the box its nearly assembled. All I had to do was put the lid on and attach the handle. Then you slide the grease tray in the bottom, attach your propane and you are ready to go.The grill lights very easily with the built in igniter. Simply turn the gas on, push the igniter button and flame. It cooks evenly and distributes heat well. What I don't like about this small grill is the lack of a thermometer. In the larger \"Q\" grill it includes a thermometer in the lid, this small portable one has lost that feature.All in all it's a great grill, it is built very well, nearly assembled when it arrives, very portable and looks great.  I would recommend this grill if you are looking for a portable one. This grill would get 4 stars.-------The larger model grill with the stand arrived packaged very well and had zero damage. Assembly was fairly easy, however one of the screws refused to go in, it got stock and stripped pretty bad. I saw another reviewer with similar issues so I have to question the quality control of the build.Now, even with one screw not in the grill still sits on the stand pretty solid thanks to the 11 other screws used to hold it together. The stand was \"easy\" to put together, although it sure would have been nice if they had labeled the parts or had you know... words in the directions. I actually installed parts of the stand backwards and didn't realize until after I had it nearly done. The directions are mainly just pictures so I got confused. A little sticker like \"A\" or \"Front\" to help indicate what part is what would be awesome.Now once the stand is assembled the grill pops on easily, you screw it in, attach the lid, the temp gauge and the handle/light and you are ready to cook. The grates are heavy duty, the grill is able to be moved with little trouble and I love it. My old \"Q\" grill similar to this said \"WEBER\" along the top on the lid. This grill is nearly identical but instead of \"WEBER\" it now has the \"Q\" logo printed in the metal.Overall I love this grill, I wish assembly was a bit more clear, but it was easy to resolve my issues.  If you are looking for a outdoor grill the larger model with the stand and collapsible tables is an awesome one, like I said I had an older model on my patio with the basic weber cover over it for years and it still works perfect."

I have not done much cooking on this yet (it's been below freezing since I received it) but plan on using it often during the summer and updating my review accordingly."

        "text": "Weber Q3200 - PropaneWe've been using a Weber Q200 at our cabin for more than 5 years (there is now a new version Q2200).  It is a handy size for portability & storage.  We bought the optional stand for it which makes it easier & more comfortable to use.  You can cook 6 steaks with room to spare & then pick up the grill & store it away.  The only downside to the Q200 (Q2200)  compared to the bigger Q3200 is that it takes longer to get ripping hot because it has 1 burner vs. 2 burners on the Q3200.  That  makes a difference in preheating time, getting a good sear and maintaining high heat.  But the Q2200 does a really good job if you just adjust your cooking technique to accommodate the lower heating ability.  It also helps to use a 20 gallon propane tank with the smaller grills instead of those little camping LP bottles.  You will also need to purchase a hose & regulator but it's worth it to improve the grilling capability.The Q3200 is quite a step up in grilling quality.  It has a lot more room, 2 burners & attached cart.  We tried it in very cold winter weather & it heated well (just took a bit longer to preheat), it seared well & maintained heat.  It is impressive for a grill this size.  Our steaks were grilled perfectly with excellent caramelizing on the outside & perfectly medium rare on the inside.It took us about 2 hours to unpack & put this Q3200 together.  The directions are very good and easy to follow.  Give yourself plenty of room to spread out the parts and take your time.  It's not complicated.The LED light is actually a nice feature (I was skeptical).  You can turn it to \"auto on\" & the light will go on as you lift the lid, shining light directly on the grilling grates.  As you close the lid, it turns off.  In the fall/winter we often grill when it's dark so this will get a lot of use.  You can also choose to have it off all the time for when you're grilling during the day.This Q3200 grill is not meant to be as portable like the smaller versions of the \"Q\".  It is attached/bolted to the rolling cart (included) & the 20 pound LP tank (not included) is stored/attached to the inside of the cart.  But, if you have a truck & want to tailgate with a bunch of people, this would do the job.The porcelain-enameled, cast iron grates are very nice but I really wish Weber sold a stainless version.  I don't care how careful you are, the cast iron grates are going to flake & rust (yuck).  We BABY our old Q200.  We store it in a heated room, oil the grates every time it gets used, do not use a steel brush or a brass brush, have never left it in the rain/weather & STILL, the porcelain-coated grates started flaking after about 4 years of light use. If we had used a wire grill brush, I'm sure it would have flaked much sooner.  We use a crumpled newspaper with tongs to gently/thoroughly clean our grates.  We don't want little broken brush wires on the grates & then in our food (this happened with a good brass brush we had used on our charcoal grill).  Everything else on our old Q200 grill is perfect; even the stainless burners.  These porcelain-coated grates are the Achilles heel of the Q grills.Yes, you can replace with ANOTHER set of these same grates but you'll have the same problem; ceramic paint flakes on your food!  We have stainless grates for our big gas Weber & our Weber charcoal kettle grills - they are the BEST.  You still get killer grill marks/searing without the concern of flaking grates.  And we have never had to replace them.PLEASE Weber, MANUFACTURE STAINLESS GRATES FOR THE Q LINE!*I emailed Weber & was told the correct protective cover for the Q3200 is: Model #6553 Premium Cover**Update 4/2014:  I ordered & received the \"Model #6553 Premium Cover\" & it fits the Q3200 perfectly with the side tables folded down.**Update 5/28/2014:  I've been using this grill for 4 months now & really like it.  We had a crowd at our cabin for Memorial Weekend & used this grill a lot.  It grills really well.  Gets ripping hot quick & is a good size."

        "text": "We have had a previous version of this Weber grill (same shape, size, style) and it has done really well for the past four years. We have not had to replace grills or burners or any other part for that matter. Our even older model Weber (the big rectangular box style) did really well but we did have to do replace parts on a fairly regular basis. I only mention all of this because this style of Weber lends itself to longevity at a low price.The Weber has about the same cooking surface as our older box model but it takes up less space and less gas to heat up the inside. There are two quick-fold-down tables on either side, plastic and easily wipe-able surface. There are hooks on the table for hanging utensils and grill cleaners. The ignition doesn't fail. It lights quickly. Our four year old model still lights without issues. There are two burner knobs to give you a lot of control over the amount and placement of your heat/flame. The grills clean up about the same as any other grill, with some elbow grease.We've cooked ribs, burgers, steak, fish, veggies, etc all with great results.The tank sits at the back with a plastic mesh cover to hide it. This is actually an issue if it is your custom to turn the gas off at the tank after each use. It is hard to get to it without pulling the grill out to reach the gas knob on the tank.This model has upgraded a couple of little things. There is a rack holder on the front so there is a place to store the warming rack. The built-in light is somewhat useful if you are grilling in the dark. It illuminates enough to see the inside of the grill but it does get in the way sometimes when opening the lid. You can easily remove it and just have the handle.The framework is just about all plastic but I can say that it does not fade or crack. Our older model looks just as new as this newer grill but we also do not move it around a lot. It occasionally gets covered but often is fully exposed to the elements.The grease catcher at the bottom does get a lot of rain water in it, whether the grill is covered or not. This is frustrating because if you don't toss it after every use, it can overflow and get gross.Overall, a great design and perfect grill for most everyday uses."

        "text": "Electric barbecuing? Wouldn't it be easier to just cook in your oven? Not necessarily. Grilling can be a very messy affair, and cleaning an outdoor grill is a lot easier than cleaning spattered grease off the wall of your kitchen and range. And cooking outdoors is a great way to cook when you're entertaining in warm weather. Back yard parties are a lot more fun when you don't have to spend most of your time in the kitchen cooking burgers.I've had the LP gas version of this grill for almost four years now, and I've been very pleased with it. The construction is solid, and maintenance is easy. I wondered how an electric grill would compare in ease of use and quality of cooking, so when a review unit became available I requested one. It was about 10 degrees below zero when my unit arrived, so I couldn't test it right away (I could; I just want to!) but a week later it was a toasty 28 degrees so I hauled it on to the back porch and fired it up.That's something you wouldn't do with a gas unit, owing to the fire hazard. An electric grill can still be a fire hazard, but it's a lot safer next to or on a wooden structure than a gas or charcoal unit, as you won't get sparks leaving the grill or open flames. That's a plus. If you're an apartment or condo dweller with an outdoor porch you probably have restrictions regarding having open flames on the porch, but an electric grill is probably okay. And homeowners can use it in their garage i=on rainy days without fear of carbon monoxide poisoning- a real concern with charcoal and gas.Now an electric grill is not going to give you the same flavor as hardwood charcoal, but then, neither will a gas grill. This grill heats up as fast as my charcoal grill and the heat is as even. On the down side, there's only one zone (my gas Weber has two) so it's not as flexible. But it gets just as hot, and you never run out of gas. Electric heat is expensive when you're heating your home, but it's cheap compared to buying propane in 20 lb cans, so that's another plus.I tried cooking burgers in mine, and I can report it does a fine job of that. I also grilled some peppers, onions, tomatoes, and summer squash, and it did a fine job with them, too. It gets how enough that I think my next test might be making pizza in it, if I can find an affordable pizza stone for it. If I do, you'll read about it here."

Having had full size (Weber Genesis) most recently, I wanted to see what the difference was using a table top version (that I could use when not wanting to fire up the full size grill and also to take on camping trips). I was pleasantly surprised with the Weber 2200. First, it is larger (and heavier) than I expected. Grill/cooking space wise, I couldn't ask for more space for two people. It is sturdy, lights like a full size grill and I love the LED light that lights the surface when the grill top is opened. I honestly have put the grill on my patio full time now and have used it almost exclusively for the past few weeks. I find cleanup easier than the full size and the fat drains off cleanly and efficiently. I may never go back again to the Genesis (unless of course I have a party with many people there). But, if that's the case, I may use the full size for hot dogs and burgers and use the 2200 for kabobs (fire them both up). I love it!!!"

First thing I noticed was how heavy it was - I had to really struggle just to get it off my doorstep.  Once I did get it inside, putting it together was very simple, screw on the lid handle and put the pins in at lid hinge set the grills down and your done.  I really like the fold out side trays, and the fact that everything folds in on itself very neatly for portability.  For this grill, I felt like it's strength was also a bit of con - it is so well built and sturdy, that it is almost too heavy to carry around.  Perhaps putting wheels on one end and making it where you could tilt it up and wheel it around would have been better.  In spite of it's weight, I still really love it and think it deserves 5 stars because it is so solid (nice thick lid, and sturdy thick grates) that it will likely last longer than me.  I don't expect I'll ever need to buy another camping grill.  I plan on purchasing the griddle insert before my next camping trip, because I love the idea that you can leave one grate in, and then put the griddle in where the other grate would be - eggs on the griddle and sausge on the grate, yum!"

        "text": "Electric grills are the shame of some urban meat eaters, but with the Q 2400, they can finally crawl out of the shadows and stand up proudly.  It may have a plug, but this is no dressed up griddle.  It is a grill and does what grills do.BUILDI have a Weber charcoal grill, and found the quality substantially better than most common brands.  The same applies to this portable size.  Everything is heavy duty and has a premium look.  The hinge is sturdy and should last for years without issue, and the lid could take a heavy beating without losing functionality.The grill surface is the same heavy porcelain-enameled cast iron that I have enjoyed on the bigger grill, which holds heat well and is easy to clean.  Speaking of that, a thorough cleaning is not too difficult and the drip pan uses the standard size, which means that you can buy disposable liners if you wish.FUNCTIONIt is a very strange feeling to warm up a grill without a charcoal chimney or tank of propane.  Instead, it only requires being plugged in for 20 minutes with the lid closed.  Make sure that your outdoor outlet can handle the 1560 Watt draw, which is similar to a space heater on high.  A standard circuit should be fine as long as nothing else (garden tools, etc.) is on it.  If you are going to break the rules and use an extension cord, make sure it is properly rated for the job.Adjusting the heat requires no airflow management.  Instead, it is all handled by twisting the knob.  Bring your own thermometer if you doubt the guidelines in the book, since one is not built into the lid.The moment of truth came when I dropped my first animal product onto the grill.  To my manly delight, it sizzled and smoked just like any other grill.  It also made beautiful grill marks.  I also was able to use wood chips similar to a propane grill to add some flavor.  The food was delicious, with a clean flavor unique to this type of grill, but still a distinctly &#34;grilled&#34; flavor.  I was worried, but it was able to stay very hot despite it being cold outside.SUMMARYThe rituals of grilling, particularly with charcoal, are absent with this unit, but beyond that psychological barrier, it delivers proper grilled food.  As with other Weber products, it is superior in durability and grill surface.  The only significant change I would prefer is a built-in thermometer."

I've only grilled burgers so far on it and it can accommodate well 4 Costco burger patties. You could squeeze in a couple more but then the cooking probably won't be as even.I like that the grille does not have any opening right above the burner thus preventing grease and other debris from falling onto the latter and clogging it.I wish that it came with a built in thermometer but I think that using the grilling guide that was included can be a reasonable substitute.Lastly even fully assembled it fits in its original box so it makes it easy to store away when not in use."

However, the grill is somewhat limited by the amount of heat that can be generated by an approximately 1500 Watt element. So, you would not necessarily have the best of luck preparing food that requires very high heat or an actual flame. You also do not have the option, of course of using smoke woods as flavoring. But for most applications, the Weber Q1400 is fine, requires no fuel watching, and is very reliable. We have had a previous (almost identical) model for many years, and it is still going strong!*****Incidentally, if you already have the cart sold for the Q140, it WILL fit the newer Q1400 model.*****"

        "text": "First off, I'm happy to see Weber putting forward a new version of this grill and not getting complacent.  I own the predecessor Q200/Q220 grill, so this review will compare the old to the new.The majority of this grill comes pre-assembled.  The parts you have to put together are trivial.  Weber also conveniently includes a disposable aluminum liner pan so your permanent aluminum pan doesn't have to be washed.  Nice!  Weber's manual is straight forward and gets you going quick.  Per the manual, make sure you check for leaks after you connect the gas just to be safe.  Besides the manual, you get a water resistant Grilling Guide that has common grilling tips on the front an approximate grilling time chart on the back for different types of meat.  Do yourself a favor though and get an instant read thermometer so you can grill based on meat temperature instead of solely on time.  Both the manual and the guide come in English, Spanish, and French Canadian.This grill is perfect when grilling for 4-6 people, maybe even up to the 8.  If you commonly grill for 1-4 people, consider getting the next size smaller to save on gas.  For my tests, I connected a 5LB gas canister using a non-Weber adapter hose which is done for convenience by me and many other people.  The manual says to use either 14.1oz or 16.4oz cylinders, and does not explicitly address the subject of using an adapter hose with larger tanks.  However Weber does sell a Q Adapter Hose for use with 20lbs tanks so that might suggest how they feel about the matter.The porcelain-enameled cast-iron cooking grates felt rock solid and are easy to clean.  Having a split grate, which is a new feature, makes it easier to pull them off to clean but also gives you the option to get a griddle for one side.  Honestly, I'd rather just bring a cast iron skillet with me instead of messing with a messy griddle.  Weber's griddle pictures, by the way, show shrimp being grilled on a griddle but I've also done shrimp on the grate and they come out amazing.While grilling, I tested for hot spots but didn't find anything obvious.  However, certainly some of the hot dogs I made were cooked more so than others so there are definitely hot spots.  Most seemed near the flames oval on the right and left side.  One missing feature from this grill is the ability to have more than one zone.  Ideally, I'd like to be able to have temperature knob for the left and right side as well as the ability to turn off one side completely.The fold-out trays are a must-have and feel sturdy.  For some strange reason though Weber removed the grilling tool hangers that were found on the previous model.  Also gone is the 'underbar' that is under either the left or right tray.  This could be used to hold grilling tools when folding the tray into the grill.The temperature gauge is nice to have but generally I don't trust the style built into grills as they can easily be off 25-50F.  I just use it as a point of reference.  Incidentally, the temperate gauge is now more oval and has a slightly different display.  The ignition button works like a champ, and Weber includes a battery (for Q2200) showing once again they think about even small details.The gas control knob is big and easily readable, however, I do not like how easy it is to go from on to off.  The previous model had more resistance and a better feedback \"click\" as to when you hit on and off.  This is probably the biggest disappointment of this new grill, but certainly I can adapt to the new knob.  And that reminds me to mention the following: always disconnect the gas canister when transporting portable grills in the car.Also, some unexpected good news.  This gill fits on the previous generation cart!  But I must say that the new collapsible cart looks superior -- I've never really like old collapsible one due to how cumbersome it was to fold them up.All in all, I rate this grill 4.5 out of 5 but I'm rounding up due to Weber's reliability, quality, and how they think about a lot of small details."

Went on fine but confused as to why this is.  Nothing in instructions about it.  2, there is a removable piece of plastic on handle that has a picture of a plug.  I have no idea what it is for.  It says it is a logo.  My only thought is that the handles are generic and they snap the logos in.  I will check next time I see a propane one in store.  3, I had a scare, got the whole thing together and no grates, I looked everywhere and could not find them.  Lifted box and it was HEAVY.  The grates were under a false bottom in cardboard.  So take everything out of box when assembling.  It's pouring rain so I can't use it yet, will get back with cooking results.

Since football season is over, I tried it out on a camping trip. It dos come in a few pieces, but it took less than twenty minutes to put everything together out of the box. It heats up quickly and evenly right through my car's cigarette adapter. The coating on the grill is not non-stick, but handled hot dogs, vegetables, and fish very well with minimal sticking, and was easy to clean. This is a big plus when I'm out in the woods with little access to cleaning supplies. Actual cooking was handled very well, and surprisingly, I was even able to get a nice sear from it, which I wasn't expecting from an electric model. I ended up getting the Weber 6549 Weber Q Rolling Cart, which is a huge plus and I really recommend using it with any of the Weber Grill models. It makes a big difference with the portability of the grill, and I think it will especially be useful for tailgating."

Once that was accomplished, and the cylinder screwed in, the unit started with just a few pops of the ignitor and heated up quite quickly.We cooked burgers and chicken breasts for our test run and both turned out just as well as on our full-size Weber. The surface area is plenty large for 4-6 of each, and we easily fit 4 burgers and 2, smallish breasts on at a time, and it was a perfectly usable height on top of a granite picnic. After cool down the unit was fairly easy to clean and seems perfect for an RV, boat, tailgating (our likely use scenario) or just any small space use-case (apartment, second home). Also useful to have on hand if you're normally a charcoal griller, but occasionally want a quick, gas grill backup.All in all, I was impressed by the power this compact unit provided. It's a high-quality grilling experience in a small package, offering the convenience of a gas grill without the usual, bulky footprint. It also seems to built to last, versus less expensive, but also far less sturdy, portable options."

We use a Weber Genesis E330 in our home and a Weber Q200 for our frequent tailgating activities.  We have used the Genesis for two years with excellent results.  We have had two minor issues with the Genesis and WEBER Customer Service responded immediately and rapidly without any hassles whatsoever.  We have used the Q200 for almost TEN (10) years with outstanding results.  It is, without question, the best &#34;portable&#34; grill money can buy.  So, recently, when we wanted a grill for a high rise condominium balcony which prohibits propane, we immediately turned to Weber.  We decided to order the Q1400 Electric.  Right out of the box we were impressed with the rich appearance and full assembly.  The cord is relatively short (6 foot), but this is understandable for safety reasons.  We wish we would have ordered the optional cart, but a sturdy tempered glass top table served to elevate the grill to a comfortable level for cooking.  Our first meal on the new Q1400 was filet and lobster tail.  We were a bit apprehensive about the performance of the electric grill since we are accustomed to grilling on propane.  However, the Q1400 heated quickly and cooked effectively and evenly.  We could tell little difference between cooking with the electric element versus propane.  Our meal was outstanding.  We are pleased to have found the perfect solution for grilling on a condominium balcony which prohibits propane.  The ONLY negative we can offer is the fact that WEBER has long prided themselves on manufacturing their products in the USA.  This particular model is NOT manufactured in the USA.  We were disappointed to learn this as we support American manufacturing whenever possible.  With regards to all other respects of the product, we highly recommend the Weber Q1400."

The Q1200 and Q2200 are identical other than a somewhat smaller size with one over the other. I would recommend you buy the optional Weber Q Adapter Hose and a 20 pound Propane tank for either. Mine last a year with a LOT of use on our larger Q300 model and you will save a fortune on the disposable, portable, VERY expensive litle cylinders. Even if traveling I would use the 20 pound tank, it simply just works best for us.So why do I need 3 grills anyway? Well I recently have lost the use of my legs and even with leg braces, sometimes can't even stand, much less walk.  So what may seem extravagant at first, is really not at all. The Q300 on it's factory stand is now just too tall if in my wheelchair or Mobility Scooter the wife just bought me for Christmas. It is a Pride Victory Sport 4 wheel model and I am able to swivel the seat to face to ANY direction.  I use the Q2200 on the front patio concrete table (nice and LOW for me and drive right up to it, swivel my seat directly to the grill and off I go.  SO easy and I still get to participate, not just mope around feeling useless... I bought a cheapo dolly on wheels to carry the extra 20 pound propane cylinder we bought since the one in the big Q300 is a nightmare (for ME) to take in and out each time if switching grills. The Q300 is for when family or neighbors come over then THEY get to do the cooking and work!So why that dolly with wheels for the 2 smaller grills? Well I have a large hot tub out in the back yard and instead of moving ALL the stuff if I want to cook at the hot tub I simply bought a cheap little table (LOW!) next to that tub. I hook my dolly/cart and pull it like a trailer with that 20 pound propane (extra tank), simply connect 1 line end to the Q1200 and off I go. If not disabled I know it may not make good sense? But for ME? It is like getting a little piece of my life back. I am not buying covers for these smaller grills since my large one on the Q300 has the top just about rotted off from sun damage. I now place a towel over the top of that cover and should have thought about that years ago. The 2 smaller grills seem to be made of exact same materials and I see no reason to even bother covering but will just fit a small piece of plastic tarp over them if it EVER rains here in Southern California! (Camp Pendleton area). We have had weather in the 80's all this month of January....There really is no assembly to speak of compared to the nightmare I had with the Q300.  In fairness, I suppose it wasn't all that hard either but with the stand and at that time I was just beginning to fight with disability, it kinda kicked my behind. I did have a problem with the Q2200 with the igniter electrode assembly. Could not get that sucker to spark!  It would light with a match but no other way. My Q300 has NEVER missed a beat so I called customer service. If you ever have to do so, be prepared for a shock. An American IN America will answer the phone, speak perfect English and be very helpful! I know, it seems like a likely story right. Even I thought maybe it was the pain medication:-)  Long story short, the woman was SUPER nice and said she would RUSH a new igniter electrode assembly. I went back and did the assembly of the other Weber and it worked fine. So I keep tinkering with this and found a wire not properly seated. I checked that prior for what seemed like a dozen time but guess I air headed it and flat missed it or who knows what. I called back l later to explain I did NOT need that part but it was already \"processed\". I told her I would ship it back at my expense and she told me to keep it for a spare! So America IS still alive and well. At least with some companies anyway. I will continue to be a Weber customer for life as I have been all along.I normally never give a 5 star rating right off the bat for ANY product. I have written hundreds of reviews and don't believe in going on some honeymoon rant about how amazing a product is in the first 10 minutes of use, have it burst into flames or fall apart in a hundred pieces then never go back to correct that review. But this product is different. It is essentially (BOTH the Q1200 and Q2200) just junior versions of my old and trusty Q300. I couldn't ask for more. It has served me well, the company has proven itself to me to be simply amazing at caring for it's customers AFTER sale. I would give 10 stars if I could. Weber has earned that from me and done it the old fashioned way. With quality products, and quality service.I would end with only this. If you are not disabled you may want to consider their optional stand? If not, at least just remember to NOT set it on something that may melt or catch fire:-) Trust me, I have accidentally grilled a couple really nice plastic tables UNDER my grill in my time....My concrete table work just great for me now however."

        "text": "Dare I say it?  Well, I will say it again, PERFECTION!  I was a bit skeptical at the ability of an electric grill being able to perform as a propane or charcoal grill could but I have eaten my doubt and words.Product arrives in a big box but is actually rather compact; this is because there is no base for the grill to sit on.  That base cart can be purchased as an accessory.  I have always taken issue with the fact that Weber makes you purchase this cart separately.  For a little bit more they should just include it with your original purchase.I wish that we could have used this grill outside but since we have been dealing with the &#34;POLAR VORTEX&#34; for the last month there has never been a warm or dry enough day to sit on the balcony grilling while dreaming of a NY steamy summer.  We opted to grill inside and I will be the first to warn you against doing this UNLESS you have previously done this and understand that there will be a lot of smoke and you will have the smell of street cart vendor stuck to everything on your body!  We set up an air machine, ceiling fan and opened a few windows on this frigid day (21 degrees) and grilled.  There was the mandatory 20 min pre-heat prep for proper searing and temperature regulation.  This wasn't an issue as I took the time to prepare our meal and prep the pork belly and pork chops.The grill heats up quickly and evenly.  I assumed that the metal dome top would steam everything rather than provide a true sear to anything.  I was extremely surprised when all the chops including the pork belly came out beautifully seared and the fat on the pork belly was perfectly charred to our liking.  It was so QUICK!!  Honestly it was quicker than our infrared propane grill on the balcony that we use during the summer.  You have to keep the lid down and this effectively cooks everything quickly and provides the right amount of heat combined with the awesome grates.A tiny issue is that cooking surface is a bit small.  We had to cook everything in 3 batches.  Again, the grill is super quick!  There were two pork bellies and 2 odd shaped chops that would fit at a time.  If you need a better example: Imagine 6 center cut boneless chops; that is what you can grill at one time on the small surface.  Depending on what we are preparing it is not enough space for a family of five.Clean-up is pretty simple and straight-forward.  The grates soak in the sink and then can be wiped clean with your sponge.  You will not need any scouring pads or harsh barbecue brushes.  The bottom bowl located beneath the heating element that catches all the grease/juices is also simple to clean.  Pop out and wash.  This has been the easiest grill we have ever had to clean.Highly recommend for apartment dwellers that are not allowed because of board rules, landlords or city regulations to have a gas or charcoal grill on their patio, balcony or outdoor space.  This item was made for big cities and any New Yorker would love one.  At first I balked at the price thinking that it would be exactly like a George Foreman, but after trying it out I truly believe that it is worth every penny.  I just wish that they would include the cart.  We simply placed it on top of our washer/dryer.  It was smoky but it is even that way when we grill outside on our balcony.  I would also recommend for the consumer that does not want to deal with charcoal or the constant change of propane tanks.  This is as simple as it can get and your family or guests will most likely not be able to tell the difference."

My wife takes wonderful are of children, grandchildren, pets and indeed, me, but indoor plants....not going to happen.

        "text": "I should start by saying that I am generally very resistant to using any soil product with fertilizer included because I garden organically (at least outdoors) and have never had any problem getting vegetables or flowers to grow without any fertilizers. Forests grow pretty well on their own with only nature's own fertilizer: the compost of decaying biological matter.That said, I will use fertilizers (I use liquid Miracle Grow primarily) for houseplants (as long as they are not producing vegetables or fruit) because a) I'm not eating them and b) it's hard to create a good composting environment indoors. There is no question that a good liquid fertilizer helps indoor plants *if* you use it regularly. A time-released pellet form is actually better because it avoids the feast-or-famine cycle that is created with liquid fertilizers (particularly if you're not consistent when it comes to feeding).I mention all of this because this soil also includes fertilizer--and that is my only complaint. As far as being a good moisture-retention soil, it does, in fact, work quite well--particularly in smaller pots that dry out faster. I live in New England and the only windows that get enough light in winter to grow certain types of plants are south-facing and even in the dead of winter, that light can get very hot. Also, with the hot-air furnace cranking, plants dry out super fast. So I took four plants (two clivia miniata plants, an avocado that hasn't fruited yet, and a Christmas cactus) and repotted them with this Miracle Grow mix and i would say that, roughly, it has doubled the time between waterings--and that does save me a lot of trouble and it saves the plants a lot of stress if I forget to water. The primary water-retaining agent, by the way, is just sphagnum peat, which you can buy separately and add to any potting soil. There is also an unspecified \"wetting agent\" included in this soil.I really wish that Miracle Grow (Scott's) would make a non-fertilized version of this because I also grow indoor fruit like Meyer lemons and I eat those--and would prefer to grow them organically.So, yes, works great for house plants, particularly flowers, so that's why it's getting four stars. It will do your houseplants a lot of good.  I just don't understand this need to add fertilizer to everything--have you tried to buy soil without it lately? It's a real search, even at big garden centers."

        "text": "This is a good all around gardening potting mix.  I find it never had a lot of sticks in it- though like other potting soils it always seems to be better to buy in the spring than later in the year towards the fall.  Later bags tend to have bigger 'chunks' in them for some reason.I like it enough to buy about a bag a week.  In early spring I can often find better prices than this in the big box stores, but not always.  The least I've seen it for is $7 on sale, but it often runs around 10-12 for 2 cubic feet, so I might as well buy it on Amazon and have it delivered and save the gas.  It's really a LOT easier on my back this way.It has a lot of peat in it which absorbs water keeping the mix damp longer.  When starting seeds, it is just very important to get the seed tray good and wet the first time after you start them, but then monitor them closely and don't over water - if you do the seeds can just rot instead of sprouting, but that first good watering is needed to soften up the seed shells.Sometimes if I have another mix, I will use it on the bottom and then this on TOP of my pots.  That still helps keep water in.I've started tons of seeds in this in my greenhouse- they don't have a hard time at all pushing up through it because it's a finer mix than some, and it helps give seedlings the moisture they need so they don't dry out until they get some size and their second leaves.I've not had any problems with weeds coming up in it or anything either, like I have some cheaper brands.  Only stuff that comes up is what I plant.The bags are a pretty thick plastic too, and I've never had one arrive busted.  Amazon has been putting mine in cardboard to ship too though, so they've been arriving nice and secure.  I wish they'd get the 2.5 cubic feet back in stock, it is a bit better yet on the budget."

At about an inch-and-a-half tall I put the seedlings in larger containers. The top couple inches of soil is a 50/50 mix of the starter mix and this potting mix for more fertilizer and extra water retention, since seedlings are so sensitive to drying out. This potting mix has .21 - .11 P - .16 NPK, polymer-coated for slow release over a few months. (The starter mix has very little fertilizer, to keep from burning new roots.) Below that 50/50 mix I putMiracle-Gro Garden Soil for Flower and Vegetable, since we don't plant tomatoes outside here until June, and it will set the roots in something more suitable for outdoors.They're doing great in that mixture, with more than twice as much leaf growth as seedlings in the local nursery medium in the same size containers. (When they go into the ground outside they'll get less nitrogen in the fertilizer. Keep in mind that the NPK composition of growth medium and soil cannot be directly compared to that of fertilizer additives, which are a lot more concentrated so they can be diluted in the soil.)This mix looks like slightly dark sphagnum peat moss, the main listed ingredient, with few twigs, and just a bit of perlite. The package says it may also include, as the second listed ingredient, processed forest products, peat and/or compost.

We did move it to a tree, but so far we've had no luck with any birds. Admittedly, the birds around our house are a little crazy. They seem to prefer dog food over any seeds we buy.

It was already together except for the chain that it hangs from and that took less than a minute to latch on to the sides. It latches on very strong so it hangs safely and evenly. The only draw back I could see is out Baltimore Orioles are about the size of a big Robin so there isn't too much room for them to land and stay on it to eat. They're not hear yet so I'll have to wait and see if they can stay on it to eat as I'm hanging it from a flower pot hook. It will be nice to not have it sit on the ledge of the patio anymore.UPDATE: I now have over 50 Orioles out here eating the jelly from this. Good thing it's easy to fill. I've had the liquid Oriole feeders out for years but this is the first time I've used jelly and they aren't even going to the liquid feeders when there is any jelly left in here.

Assembled, the feeder stands approximately 8&#8221; high and is 8.5&#8221; in diameter. The plastic bottle has a capacity of approximately 20 fluid ounces. Empty, the feeder weighs under 2 ounces. The base plate includes a outer edge that birds can use for toe holds, and 3 holes on the outer edge that could accommodate a hanging chain or twine (shown in the product photo, but NOT included). The feeder is designed so that the plastic bottle can be replaced with a jelly jar (2.25&#8221; diameter, slightly smaller than standard home canning jelly jars).I was thoroughly unimpressed with the quality of this feeder, starting with the fact that no chain or other hanging implement was included in the package. It is up to you to find a way to hang the feeder, either that, or you will need to set the feeder on a ledge or table. In general, orioles do like fruit, especially oranges, so this feeder might be attractive if you've got orioles in your neighborhood.

You can fill the jar that it comes with or just screw on the jelly jar that you buy.  I bought a Smuckers jar and it screwed right on.  Then just hang in the tree and wait."

In the past we had the open dish Oriole feeder, i.e., a block of wood with two openings for dishes in which you placed the jelly.  It worked well but it was buggy and nasty after awhile.  This feeder encloses a full jar of grape jelly and the jelly moves down and out as the birds eat.  Just had our first Orioles of the season feasting in this earlier this morning---wonderful feeder!"

Being able to simply screw a large jar of grape jelly directly onto the feeder base is the perfect solution.  Even better, the stirrer located on the bottom of the Perky-Pet Oriole jelly feeder conveniently provides portion control.  Squeezing the jelly jar quickly refills the base too.  I wondered if rain would turn the jelly into a watery mess, but that has not been the case and the holes in the base help drain off water build-up.This jelly feeder is an oriole magnet.  We usually attract a few orioles with oranges, but after putting up this feeder, they swarm the yard.  Just before their return, we noticed pretty house finches sampling the jelly too."

It is still cold here, so the jelly didn't go very far, but I wonder how well it will work during hot weather.  Will the jelly melt right out?  Well, so far that has not been a problem because every morning I have woken up to the feeder tipped upside down.  Something (deer? squirrel? wind?) has been flipping it.  The whole thing works on balance - the three cheap chains only attach to the base.  If the balance gets off, the whole thing rolls right over.  I will keep it outside and hope that it has good days, but would not buy another.  The best one I have found so far is one like the Birds Choice 1009 Oriole-Fest Oriole Feeder.  It can hold sugar water (1 part sugar to 5 parts water), jelly, and an orange half.  This attracts the most orioles by far and also hummingbirds.Update: A bear pulled down all of my bird feeders including this. The cheap chain snapped into individual links.  I re-hung it by putting an eye hook into the (plastic) bottom of the jelly jar and hung it from a planter hook.  At least that solved the flipping problem.  I went to buy more jelly today and found that many brands still sell in glass jars.  Looks like I will be decanting into my old plastic one.  It works much better this way. I do get lots of birds (warblers?) at this feeder.  The orioles switch from the orange half to this."

I did observe a hooded oriole come to this feeder once after I hung it, and it hung untouched after that. The feeder allows you to fill up the plastic jar that comes with it and then screw it directly into the feeder; a handle underneath connects to a blade that pushes into the jar that, when the handle is turned, pushes the jelly down into the surrounding tray. This way you can keep dispensing the jelly as it gets eaten. You can also attach a standard-sized jelly jar and it'll fit fine. One issue I noticed is that if too much jelly dispenses it can be easy for the jelly to spill if it is windy.Overall this is a good feeder, it just didn't work well for me because my local orioles don't seem to like jelly much."

Our experience has been similar in terms of the number of species.  His feeder is essentially a hanging dish, and he puts jelly in it every morning.  This one accepts a jar, and you just turn a handle on the bottom to feed more jelly -- at least that's the theory.  Maybe it's the brand of jelly we are using, but it isn't quite that easy.  The jelly isn't fluid enough and tends not to just run down, plus cleanup is not as easy as our friend's open style.  Of course we could just leave the jar off and put the jelly in each morning.

Then turn over the rectangle, cover the bottom with weed fabric, and it's ready to fill - I will be using a mixture of 1/3 peat moss, 1/3 topsoil and 1/3 compost.When I got the box upright, the tops of the boards seem to want to separate.

So in short- I love these. They are beautiful, easy to use and look wonderful in your front or backyard. Perfect for my small raised garden bed :)"

        "text": "I intended to build a raised garden bed last spring and kept intending to build it all last summer.  But my lack of DIY building skills -- particularly when it comes to making square corners with pieces of wood -- made the project seem too intimidating and I kept putting it off. All winter I thought about the raised bed I wanted and was thrilled to get these.These corners allow me to build the raised bed I want without having to worry about whether I could make square corners because the 2 by (6, 8 or 10) boards fit into the channels in the corners.  There are little flanges (the manufacturer calls them levers, but they don't move) that keep the boards in place.  It can take some adjusting the wood into place with a mallet, but the corners will be square!If you have to worry about frost heave, as I do in Minnesota, there are 4 holes in the bottom of each corner so you can put screws (or corner brackets) in to really hold the wood in place.  You may also want to put screws in the upper corner joints, especially if you use 2 by 10 boards, to keep the upper edges to stay together after you fill the garden bed with soil.  The good news for people like me is that the boards are already secure so you don't need to worry about the corners going out of square while the extra screws go in!The corners are 6 inches tall so they will look prettier if you use 2x6 or maybe even 2x8 boards.  But I wanted a deeper garden bed so I used 2x10s.  It isn't as aesthetically nice as with a smaller board, but practicality won out.  I expect that these will eventually rust being left out through Minnesota winters so I bought fir rather than cedar in hopes that the corners and wood last about the same time."

You don't need other tools to assemble the bed -- just the brackets and boards.I think these are really neat looking. If I were using these for flower beds I would have painted the boards turquoise or some bright color, which would look really nice through the cut out sections. As it is I am using these for potato beds.They feel sturdy enough, particularly with my addition of the cross piece. I am very pleased with the look and feel of the bed."

They're very pretty, made of powder coated steel and you just fit your wood - any size 2&#34; lumber - right into the corners. It's really easy! You can also purchase separate Stake Holders if you want to add garden states for plant supports, or protective covers for bugs or frost.Makes making raised bed gardens easy and is highly recommended!"

        "text": "First let me say that I am landscaped and garden challenged. I have trouble pulling weeds because I don&#8217;t really know the difference between a weed and a plant, especially when I am not the one who planted it. I do have a patch of dirt in the backyard with nothing there, and I thought a basic garden bed would work there and maybe I might like just putting things in there and hoping it will turn into something nice.  It turns out I have a shaded area so I need to be choosy with what I put there, but fortunately getting the bed up was not an issue.  Others are right, additional anchors were needed, but the corners look very nice and setting up was not a big issue at all. I would readily get this for someone, not only because it&#8217;s easy but this specific kit allows that person to basically design their own size, within limits. This would not be ideal for say a very large community garden."

        "text": "The AeroGarden arrived in very good condition and was easy to put together.  I had to double check the instructions to make sure I was getting the water and nutrients into the tank correctly.  The pods are already planted with seeds so that makes it easier not having to deal with very tiny seeds.  The label needs to stay on the top of each pod because it assists with moisture control.  The label also gives the name of the plant(s), it's expected germination time, and it's height.  As the instructions recommend, it is better to place shorter plants in front; the taller ones to the outsides and middle back.  Placement is much more critical with taller vegetables than herbs which will be used earlier and kept trimmed more regularly than a tomato for example.  I'm at day 12; the plants are all now sprouted and above the label.  The clear caps are off all but two that have just made it above the label this morning.  The caps come off when the plant is touching the top.  The caps help maintain a more humid and warm environment during the germination phase.  There is a recommendation in the instructions to remove surplus plants within each pod which I have yet to do.  Each basil has 5 to 6 plants; the mint is very tiny.  Since it is just getting above the label it's hard to count plants yet.  It looks like the parsley and chives have more seeds sprouting down below the label but it might be a couple days before I can be sure.The two types of basil are ready for their first trimming below the initial leaves to stimulate side growth.  It has been really fun to check it every morning to see what is new.  I grew up on a farm/ranch and have lots of experience growing everything from vegetables to fruit trees.  But, that was in the past, in a different place which is what makes this, sitting near my kitchen, all that much more fun to do it again.Pods are available pre-seeded with vegetables and flowers, or as a kit to put together with one's own seeds.  The lights do stay on for 17 hours each day.  They are pre-programmed on their own timer.  At least that's the way this model works.  There are smaller, less computerized models available, but they all use grow lights.  The grow lights do need to be replaced on a regular basis.  The lights are not expensive.  The computer unit keeps a daily countdown of days until nutrients need to be put into the water, and the water refilled to it's correct level.  There is also a recommended schedule of cleaning the water tank and replacing the water and nutrients.  This is a pretty well thought-out product providing a lot of fun, resulting in a crop of herbs, vegetables, or flowers."

        "text": "[I bought this garden directly from the website since it was not on Amazon at the time.]Lights - The lights are a nice upgrade if you have an AeroGarden 7. The AeroGarden 7 only has two lights, this Ultra garden has three. I did notice though that the lights in the Ultra sometimes flicker, I'm not sure why. Maybe I have bad bulbs, I did notice on the website some people reporting that the light goes well before it's time. You're covered for six months on the bulb, I would suggest getting extra in case something happens though.The heat from the bulb is pretty warm too. If your seedlings are sensitive to heat then the heat from the bulbs could actually burn them. I have pepper seedlings in mine and they seem to be doing great right now.Pump - Unlike the AeroGarden 7 which has an air stone the Ultra has a water pump and no air stone. If you wanted to the Ultra has two holes which can feed an air line, you would also need to buy an air stone too. It looks like it would take a normal size air line, I am not completely sure however. So far I have no problems with the pump, they sell replacement pumps on the website if you need to replace it. If you have an air stone in the system when pump goes then you don't need to worry too much about rushing it because the air stone will provide enough air to keep them alive. Remember, the AeroGarden 7 does not have a pump just an air stone.The pump also pumps out water on the side of the sponges too.Digital Stuff - My biggest problem is here. They didn't put much testing into this. The way some stuff is written it seems like it was written in another language then translated. Also, when the power goes out you will lose some data such as the nutrient cycle. When my power went out the nutrient cycle completely reset, so even if the water is bare of any nutrients the system will not tell you to add any because of this. I don't see anyway to change it back so now I need to rely on a PPM meter all the time. You can get this meter from amazon. They claimed they fixed this issue but apparently they didn't.The LCD light is so bright too! There is no way to turn it down or off. I have it in my room so I have to put a sock or something over it at night just to sleep.The Ultra also allow you to use custom settings. I don't think I will ever use them. Could be fun to try new things with it though.Design - The design looks nice, it don't take up much room. It's about 15 inches long and 11 inches wide. The plug that goes into the light does not go in all the way. I think they made the plugin part too long. It don't bother me too much but it would look nicer if it actually fit correctly. This system should also be easy for you to clean compared to the AeroGarden 7.Seed Kit - Mine came with a pepper seed kit, the one on Amazon comes with an herb seed kit. With the pepper seed kit you can only grow two plants, which is kinda silly because the AeroGarden 7 is smaller and allows you to grow 3 tomato plants. I would think pepper plants would be less in a bigger container? Maybe I'm wrong.  I don't really like how the AeroGarden seed kits only come with so many. I could fit another tomato plant inside the AeroGarden 7, giving me 4 plants instead of three. As long as you manage the size good you will do great.I had an herb kit planted in the AeroGarden 7 before I switched it to tomatoes and all the herbs did good.Nutrients - The Ultra comes with the nutrients in a squeezable bottle, which is nice. It worked ok for my cherry tomatoes in the AeroGarden 7 when it came with them. The only problem I have is you get little clumps of buildup from it which would mean more cleaning of the pump. If you're not worried about the organic label then try using general hydroponics flora series (they cannot be labeled as organic because they use machines something). It's $40 for all three needed but should last you multiple grows unlike the small bottle they give you. It does a lot better too, gives the most amazing taste to what you grow. You could also invest in a PH kit by general hydroponics too if you wish to go that far. I would keep PH around 5.5-6.0.Water - They tell you not use use well water, which is true. Well water can wreck the system. You should only use RO water or distilled water. I do have one problem with what they say though. Not every RO system is equal... some are better than others. It all depends on how the water is filtered. AeroGarden tells you not to use RO well water either if it's been softened. I don't know why but there shouldn't be a problem. My RO system produces near \"distilled\" water, and it adds some nutrients to it (such as calcium) in the last cycle so it's better to drink. Chances are if you have a at least 3-4 stage RO system then you can use it. My system is a 6-stage by iSpring for those of you that wish to know, I got it right from Amazon.Overall - This garden does have it's problems, the nutrient cycle is the biggest for me because now I have to keep testing with my PPM meter until the cycle is normal again. For an average person this could cause them to lose their plants if the water ran bare of nutrients due to this. It's best to have a PPM meter on hand because the cycle WILL mess up on you, you cannot avoid it. For seedlings you can keep the PPM around 400-600. For plants over 12 inches you can keep it at around 800-1000, but I wouldn't let it drop below 600.Would I say it's worth $250? No, not at all. With the price I paid (A little over 1/3 of the price of a smartphone priced at $700) I would want this to be in great working condition. Until they have digital problems, and lights sorted out I would stick with the AeroGarden 7 which is about $100 cheaper. They only have two seed kits made for the taller garden like the Ultra anyway, you're not missing out on much unless you want to grow bell peppers, or mega cherry tomatoes. You can still grow the smaller stuff however, so don't get confused on that."

        "text": "I'm going to make this an ongoing review, simply because it may take some time before I can verify if the AeroGarden Ultra really works.Review 1 - The AeroGarden is a decent size and is able to hold 7 seed pods. What comes with the AeroGarden is an Herb mix, stuff like Dill, Chives and Mint. I was kind of hoping for something like Strawberries or peppers, something tangible, but the herbs are a good first run.Set-up was fairly easy, simply pull all of the pieces out of the box, snap the light bulbs into place, then secure the lamp to the base, plug in the unit and you're done. Very easy.The next part was very, very cool. There is a little blue light up screen on the front of the AeroGarden, and when you start your garden you hit a button marked \"Quick Plant\". This walks you through, step by step, the planting, feeding and watering process, as well as allowing you to set the light timer. This screen will also alert you when it's time to replenish the plant nutrients and other important info.So basically we follow the steps outlined, fill the base with water to the \"fill line\", add nutrients and finally insert the seed pods into the available slots. That's it, all very easy, and kind of fun.Now I will say that you should have a place to set up your AeroGarden. While not very large, it's still about the same footprint of a microwave oven, and will need plenty of space to \"grow\" as the lamp must rise as your plants grow. We initially set the unit up in my daughter's room as she really wanted to be the one to run the AeroGarden, which was fine, until we realized that the AeroGarden's lamps must remain on for about 17 hours of the day, and WOW...those lights are BRIGHT! No way she could sleep with these bulbs burning!! So we set the unit up in our dining room. (The good new is that if we have to get up in the middle of the night to use the restroom, the blaring light from the AeroGarden shines over the entire first floor!!)I will follow up this review when I see some growth, it looks like most everything in the kit should bloom between 5-7 days.Review # 2 - Well we have sprouts!! About half the pods are showing growth, so that's pretty cool. I do have some reservations about the product, specifically...just how much power is this thing using??? The grow lights are simply BRIGHT...and they have to remain for so long! I can imagine my power meter just ticking away like a stopwatch. But we are having fun watching these things begin to pop up, and the unit is working as advertised."

The adjustable lamp makes it great for all kinds of plants and can be adjusted for growth.  The most important thing about an indoor growing system is the light and right now the light seems to do the job very well, will obviously update in regards to performance in the future.The size is what I would describe as ideal for kitchen counters but I wouldn't mind an even larger version.  The controls were also easy to use.  Will update in the future as to how it does with specific plants and how well it adapts to what we want and grow, I'm especially curious to see how well it works without the kits.Will update my review in the future but right now this is a highly recommended purchase."

        "text": "NOTE: Before deciding to buy this model, look at the just-announced LED version that AeroGarden (AG) claims to be a major improvement: More effective lighting and cheaper over time. Although the LED version lists for $100 more than the fluorescent light version, the fluorescent lights are a major expense. The fluorescent lights list at $35 (as a set of 3) and need to be replaced every six months -- comments on the AG website indicate that these lights often *burn out* around 6-8 months, not just that they become less effective. The LED version is advertised to last 3-5 years, or $210-350 worth of fluorescent bulbs. And the operating cost is less. Other than the LED lighting, that model seems the same as this one. However, see the comments below about (poor) quality of construction -- the LED model might not survive long enough to reap the benefits.Limited review: I was given this product in exchange for an honest timely review. The time limit requires me to post this review well before I have had the experience of a full cycle of growing plants. I am commenting on my early experience and will update this review as appropriate.Because of my professional background, I tend to be much more critical in my evaluations of products. You may well decide that various of my comments are irrelevant/unimportant to you, so I have tried to structure this to make it easier for you to spot and skip such comments.Details: As an engineer (software) I not only developed products but dealt with the company's marketing people about design decisions. And another part of my job was evaluating products, both competitive analysis and for purchasing decisions. One lesson-learned from dealing with Product Managers (Marketing) was to play close attention to their visible decisions because they are highly predictive of decisions that you don't immediately spot.----My first negative reaction came with unpacking the product -- it felt too insubstantial for what it was. It was not just me. I asked several neighbors to give me their quick first impression (no hints) and the responses were \"cheesy\", \"flimsy\", \"cheap\" and not built to last. However, in looking through various comments, I couldn't find complaints about this being a problem, so maybe it is tougher than it looks, or maybe people adapted.First, the plastic could easily have been a bit thicker in both the tank and the hood. Second, the pole for holding up the hood is probably more than strong-enough, but the impression was \"cheap\". The cutting-corners was evident in that AG didn't even bother to de-burr (smooth off) the rough ends of the pole. But most worrisome is that the sockets for the pole in both the base and hood are relatively thin-walled -- I would have thought they needed to be much thicker to handle the torque of even a partially raised hood.Note: I don't know how the construction of this model compares to earlier one (for you to extrapolate from the reviews of those models), but the taller (extensible) pole is an advantage for growing taller plants, but creates torque greater than those models. And the hood carries more weight from an additional bulb (3 vs 2 in the previous model).Because I know to be very careful about this, I expect that I can keep it from breaking prematurely. However, if you plan to let children help you, there may be a problem. And if you have a cat, you may have a problem: I couldn't use the initial place I planned to put the unit because I knew that my cat would be rubbing against it (curiosity and scent-marking). And I think it would be the height of folly to grow catnip in this unit (one of the seed kits that AG sells).The biggest example of corner-cutting and unimaginably bad design is the trellis. This is thin cheap plastic bar that seems to be capable of *guiding* the growth of plants, but not supporting plants such as tomatoes, much less supporting tomato plants while you are picking. The trellis was not designed for reuse from season to season: Connecting the two halves is permanent, thereby greatly increasing the likelihood it will be broken during storage. Although I don't see this being a significant factor itself in your buying decision, this is indicative of the pervasive problems with this product.----One of the basics of Marketing is to do multiple things to make your customers happy with their purchase. If this were not a review unit, I would have had significant buyer's remorse.1. The cost and frequency of replacement lighting was a major surprise (see above). Having used straight fluorescent grow-light tubes, I expected an operating life of 2-3 times these, and a lower price.2. The need to immediately buy supplemental items. For example, I hadn't considered the need to change the water in the tank. I judge it impractical to carry the tank to the sink, because of (1) the lack of grips suitable to the weight, with the risk of both spilling the water and of breaking the tank, (2) no good way of leaving the growing plants behind (at my location for the product). So the alternative is to siphon out the water into a bucket -- not great in several regards, but the lesser evil. And surprise, AG sells a siphon pump separately, but you can likely get one from a fish/aquarium store.3. Badly over-priced supplies. For example, paper labels for the pods cost $0.26 each (in bulk = 50 count). For comparison, file folder labels cost less than $0.04. The pod baskets which are trivial pieces of plastic cost $0.34 each (in bulk). The plug for unused holes is a combination of these two and is further marked up to $1.33 each (from $0.60). Furthermore, this is the wrong way to plug the holes -- the plugs should have been a more robust construction and should have been included, not an after-market purchase. Then there are the \"Grow Domes\" which are essentially the little plastic cups you put Salsa in at Mexican take-out: $0.30 each (in bulk).Advice: Before making a purchase, look at the price of supplies and decide if you are going to feel that you are being gouged. If so, that is likely to adversely affect your use or enjoyment of this product.4. Difficulty find a location for the unit. You are instructed to *not* locate this product where the plants will get sunlight because that can overwhelm them. This eliminated most of my prime locations for this unit. I was surprised that the product couldn't handle this. Then eliminate locations where draining and refilling the tank will be a problem. Then ... From what I have figured out, the product was designed on the assumption that you would find a location suitable for its requirements, rather than being designed to be adaptable to where you wanted to put it.Note: One can adjust either the starting time or ending time for the lights, but not both. Setting one automatically resets the other to have a fixed period the lights are on. I wanted to put the unit in a south-facing garden window and set the start-time to be roughly sunset, with a 6-hour runtime to supplement the natural light. You can't do this. The closest approximation I found is to disconnect the unit's lights and leave the windows lights on until bedtime.5. Mediocre instructions. While setting up the unit is easy and intuitive, there is much more to using it. There is not a coherent user manual. Instead there are several overlapping documents (equiv to Quick Start Guides), various FAQs and lots of blog-style postings. Many of these are erroneous, ambiguous, contradictory or incomplete.[1] It took me more than a 10 days to start up my unit because I repeatedly reached my frustration limit trying to hunt through the web pages to find what I thought were answers to basic questions (I am not a \"Just do it\" person). There were too many clicks and searches yielding too little result. I kept muttering that it shouldn't be that hard. Part of what you are paying for with a product like this are instructions and guides to use it successfully. But as in the manufacturing, there are big deficiencies here.Note: My professional background makes me inclined to get a more complete understanding than the typical user, partly from a well-earned paranoia. And I do understand that there are people for whom ferreting out such info is part of the joy of products such as this.6. In poking around on the AG website, I discovered many complaints about problems with the water pump. Under \"Accessories > Replacement Parks\" the description for the pump begins \"Keep your garden growing at its best with periodic pump replacement\". Looking at the pump in my unit, I had to wonder if the reliability problems were simply the result of AG skimping on this part.7. When I went to register my unit, the web site offered $125 of coupons for signing up for the newsletter. 90% of those were discounts on buying other models. Hold it. I have just started using it -- I am hardly ready to buy another, either for myself or as a gift. Marketing wisdom is that those coupons should either be to reduce the shock of the cost of supplies or to encourage purchase of add-ons that could make the user more satisfied/enthusiastic with operation.----Using for transplants:I was strongly considering using this to start transplants in the spring, but after looking at the details, I am reconsidering.1. In looking at comments on the AG website, I found numerous complaints about poor success rates. I expected transplanting from a hydroponic environment to a normal garden to be more involved than normal transplanting. What I expected to find, but didn't, were articles of the form \"How to successfully transplant\" and \"Common mistakes made in transplanting\".2. One needs to look at the comments under their \"Seed Starting System\" and not just the description. This is Styrofoam and people report that it is often non-reusable because it breaks as you remove the inserts (Grow Sponges) for transplant. And it floats on the surface of the water -- none of the air circulation around the roots that AG advertises as so beneficial (and I didn't find an explanation of why). And why don't they need the Grow Domes and the Pod Labels? Especially since the Pod Labels are advertised as useful/important in reducing the evaporation of water from the tank when you have the normal 7 pods vs 66 pods for the Seed Starting System.3. The insert is similar to theHydrofarm JSEF55 Smart Float Grow Tray with Plugs(and about the same price per position). Searching keyed to that product and its ilk may produce useful advice (I haven't looked yet).==== Examples of problem in the documentation ====1. The maintenance schedule omits any mention of the existence of the filter on the water pump, much less cleaning it and changing it (every 6-8 months). I discovered this when scanning the product offerings on the web site. Similarly, the online maintenance schedule hadn't been updated to include this model (the Ultra). This sort of sloppiness is common.Plus: The filters are very inexpensive, bur rather than including several changes, you have to purchase them, with S&H; making them *very* expensive (better alternative: go to a B&M; fish/aquarium store).2. When I clicked on what was advertised as an online tutorial for new owners, what I got was a brochure targeted at potential buyers formatted to be a glossy hardcopy handout. Most small startups try to avoid this mistake, and there is no excuse for a mature company to do it.3. The documentation for the control panel is minimal -- just enough to get you started. I put water in the tank and started experimenting, but who knows what I missed or misunderstood.4. When I looked at the advice on growing seeds for transplants, it said that the baskets came in two parts which were held together by the Pod Label. And in the AG product listing, there are \"Easy Transplant Baskets\" that \"snap away\". However, when I looked very closely at the right picture, \"snap\" seems to mean \"break\" not \"disengage\". Minor, but this is an example of the casualness of their descriptions.5. For the seed kits, the descriptions of the plants can be vague. For example, it treats \"cherry tomato\" as good enough, ignoring/oblivious to the fact that there are a wide range of cherry tomatoes for different tastes and uses. I know that they have adapted some of the plants to better fit, but why not say \"similar to variety X\"?6. Statements with no explanation. For example \"baskets help regulate moisture levels in pods\". I could find no info on when I needed to change what was happening or how to accomplish that. Or was this simply puffery?7. Fertilizer is specified using different units in different places: Milli-liters, fluid ounces, and \"season\". I can convert between the first two, but why don't they just give both together (eg, with a parenthetical). As to \"season\", if you look around on the AG website, you can find the Rosetta Stone. This is yet another example of AG not putting what seem to be normal efforts into making their documentation user-friendly.-- Douglas B. Moran"

        "text": "This is a combined small unit of grow lights over a water tank with pump that is designed for the purpose of hydroponic growing indoors.  The brochure included shows a photo of it on a kitchen counter and a very warm temperature range for the room is recommended in the instructions.  I will review each component separately:The three bulbs in the plastic hood are on a pole with clamps, so that it can be adjusted to be right over the plants.  The pole \"snapped\" into the hood a little less snug than I had expected, but it does function suitably.The seed \"pods\" came in an open plastic cone and are embedded in what looks like a synthetic foam, rather than an actual organic or mineral material.  (I took them out of that.)  Are all the seed from China, too?  Every component should be labeled with honest disclosure, as consumers demand.I looked for the common triangle on the plastic tub that would indicate what type of plastic it is made of, since it is made in China, but found none.  The \"trellis system\" is two plastic bands that strap together around the plants.  The pump seemed noisier than expected.  The little bottle of \"plant nutrient\" included is lab chemicals that the label directs the reader to look up on a website address ending with the word \"metals.\"  Nice.  (I won't be using any of that on any actual food plants.)I ran through various scenarios on the little electronic screen of the \"control panel\" on the tub, but found several of the instructions to be either way overly simplified or too inflexible to be of much use.  Those who already have growing experience, particularly indoors, will already know how important on-the-spot judgement is for a whole host of variables that cannot be simply codified without looking at the plants.The upshot for me, as an experienced organic grower, is that some features of this unit are usable while others are undesirable.  There is way too much plastic for my tastes, and I would prefer that most or all of the unit be made in the USA with more durability in mind.  It might have some fun educational value in hydroponics for children."

The AeroGarden unit was very easy to assemble by following the illustrated instructions and didn't take much time either.  It can be placed on kitchen counters, as long as there is an electrical outlet available nearby.  However, it should not be placed under cabinet lights and an area of approximately 10&#34;x16&#34; is required.  The lamp height can be adjusted to the size of the plants, but requires an initial 16.&#34;  As to the seed pods, they are easy to plant by following the instructions on the LED screen panel.  The pods are labeled and indicate the height as short, medium or tall, so it's easy to decide where to place them.  The LED screen will time the necessary daily lighting after setup, as well as indicate when watering and feeding is needed.  There is a water fill port to do the latter.  Since I needed to rate the AeroGarden within 4 weeks, our herbs are not fully grown yet.  I will adjust my rating if needed on a later date.  The only reason I gave it only 4 stars, is because the bright lights can be a nuisance at night and the replacement pods, lights, and food can be expensive.  The latter taken into consideration, it is truly an efficient indoor garden if you want fresh herbs to cook with.  (Note - Other type of seed pods are available.)"

The unit is very well made and will stand the test of time. The idea is simple its based upon hydroponics and the Pods are self contained. The idea is to set the pods into the base. Fill the base with water and nutrients turn on the grow lamps and in time the seeds will sprout and the plants will grow. Its really impressive looking and my wife and I are excited about kitchen side herbs. We were lucky to have a space for the unit close by to the Kitchen. If I can remember in a couple of weeks I will write a followup. Looks good."

        "text": "There's definitely a quirky kind of interesting that comes with having your houseplants pop up alerts on your phone saying they'd like some water.I wouldn't invest in a huge army of these to put in every pot in the house if you're a big plant keeper, but it's a neat device anyway. As it warms up, I expect to move it around the garden a few times to get a look at what it thinks of how much sun is available in the locations I have.For now, it's sitting with a plant and telling me how long it expects it to be before I need to water again, and it's also reminding me to fertilize.Sunlight is kind of a troublesome issue. It wants me to move the plant to where there's more, but the plant itself is getting more than the device is just because of how they're sitting relative to the window (and the leaves providing some shade). I also sort of wish there were a &#34;Winter&#34; mode that understood that my houseplants are probably going to have to survive with less sun for a little while, and that it might be good ease up on the fertilizer for the time being as well.I'd also really like a mode where you just put it somewhere, and then ask the database to tell you what types of plants would be likely to live in this spot happily.On the whole, it's neat to play with and there's definitely some utility to having one around. When my plants seem sickly, I'll now have a much better tool to help me figure out what I'm doing wrong. Up to now, I've tended to just end up having to buy a new plant."

        "text": "This seems a handy device for plants you wish to fuss over, because it monitors temperature, light, and fertilizer(?), as well as moisture.  Most of my garden plants have been here for ages so I don't worry about them, but for rooting cuttings, or transplanting, I have to be very careful not to let them dry out. This is a great device for doing so because I check my iphone regularly anyway.  I put the flower power app iconon the front screen, and if something needs attention, I get a red badge on the icon so that I know to open it up and see what the sensor is saying (if it is an issue I don't feel like dealing with at the moment, I can \"Ignore\" it and the badge goes away). I'm considering getting another for the front yard bouganvillia which turns brown unless it is kept moist (the others do fine in the summer), and so I am going to try using this sensor to water it just when it needs it but not more.I had no problems setting it up or connecting with the device, and it was easy to define identify what plant was being monitored (so the software would know what conditions that particular plant needs).  Once it has been running for a while, you can see the plants environmental measures over time (last day, week, month, and so forth), or query the current status via \"Live\" mode. You an also view the status over the web, assuming it has synced. I would like to know how to get an alarm or alert of freezes in my vegetable garden, but at the moment I don't see how to do that.  It lets you add and define multiple sensors so you can monitor multiple indoor and/or outdoor plants if you buy more.The iphone app is a bit large, 109mb, I guess due to the large database, so downloading took a while.  Note that it only works on newer (lower power bluetooth) iphones, so check your hardware before assuming it will work with yours.The database includes some Calif. native plants, and includes lots of mediterranean climate plants, unlike garden resources I have encountered in the past that are suited only for moister climates. It is useful for telling you care information for the plants you already have, but it is not as useful for searching for additional plants that meet the requirements of your climate.  That is, I can filter plants by type, color, bloom season, etc., but I cannot filter by hardiness or by moisture requirements.  So for example, I wanted to find perennial edibles to plant, but the 600+ list that resulted contains plants mostly unsuited to my area.  Even though once you click on a plant, that information is in the entry for that plant, so they just need to improve the search function to capture those additional constraints."

        "text": "In our family, the care and feeding of our yard is my job. While I'm generally comfortable working with a variety of trees, shrubs, herbs, and flowers, I welcome knowledgeable advice. That's why I was eager to put this helpful Parrot to work.I'll focus here on showing how the Parrot works out of the box and what it's like tapping into the specific data you gather and augmenting your knowledge with the plant library the app provides. Thus far, the unit and app both seem to be working well (including the day I let my plant dry out to see whether that would trigger a \"water me\" alert, which it did).Since I \"drive\" the Parrot with my phone, I was able to snap some screen shots for you. I've placed them, with annotations, in the customer images section on the product page.  These shots include live-action shots and historical data. The app archives data so that you can review in daily, weekly, and monthly view.  The Parrot unit gathers and stores data and transmits it via Bluetooth. The Flower Power app communicates with the \"Parrot Cloud\" by way of 3G, 4G or wifi.Setup is simple, but remind yourself that it takes at least 24 hours for the Parrot to generate its first report. In the meantime, you can dig into the Flower Power database, and start building your \"garden,\" by selecting other plants with which you will want to work. Each time your search nets a result, you can add that plant to your garden. You can personalize entries by taking photos of your plants, or use the images provided in the database. You have access to 6,000 plants.Be sure that the Flower Power app recognizes your physical location; this simple but necessary step helps with future use. Indeed, during initial use, I received notification that an update for my location (Hawaii) was available; depending on your location, you may receive a similar prompt.Speaking of locations, I am in Zone 10, which isn't ideal for some of the plants I would like to grow. However, I've checked through the app and located support for several flowers I plan to grow this year, including particular varieties of crocus and tulips. In years past, I've had varying results with these plants, so I hope that the Parrot will mean a better outcome this year.In order to make best use of the app, I would need to have multiple Parrot units. The workaround I've been using is to move the Parrot from one plant to the next on a weekly basis. In several more months, I will evaluate the overall benefit of the Parrot unit and the Flower Power database, and decide whether to buy additional units.If you have questions about the unit or the app, please post in the comments, and I will respond as soon as possible."

        "text": "The Parrot Flower Power - Wireless Indoor/Outdoor Bluetooth Smart Plant Sensor works really well although there is some room for improvement in the app.Once the app finds your device which is easy and you identify the plant of the huge database you will get alerts on water, fertilizer,, temperature, and sunlight needs. Unfortunately the app doesn't help track how much you add each time and calculate future needs based on those results. Also the app does not track anything as to the size or age of the plant so it isn't fine tuned to help with starting seedlings.I have moved the device around to several plants and it is easy to update to the new plant. However you won't get advice until it has been with the plant for 24 hours. Understandable for temperature and sunlight but I would like to be able to get water and fertilizer recommendations more immediately.Even before the 24 hours and the automated alerts/todo list the app generates you can always monitor live and see the results of adding water, changing temp, or sunlight exposure. The results are immediate but there is no indication as to the target recommended.This is a very cool device and every plant I have used it on has benefited greatly by the recommended actions. However at this price it would be tough to justify very many of these. I look forward to app improvements and I hope they optimize for iPad as it is only available in the iphone app store right now which doesn't make vest use of the larger iPad screen."

        "text": "I've owned a couple of EasyBloom devices (later sold to Black and Decker) and now this Parrot Flower Power to monitor plant conditions.  Although I'm an experienced gardener, I have houseplants located in areas that I forget to check as well as the occasional struggling plant.  The original EasyBloom didn't have soil fertility information, and when the next generation did, with a paid fertilization subscription, I was thrilled.  I was worried that this Parrot Flower Power wouldn't have that information, and again, I was thrilled that it did.  After all, an experienced gardener can tell whether a plant is likely getting the right amount of sun or water, but the richness of the soil is an entirely different matter.  For this reason, the Flower Power promises to work for both beginning and intermediate -- maybe even advanced -- gardeners.  Still, it needs some work to be a five-star product.First, a warning:  this works only on iPhones.  Not computers.  Not Android devices, although the web site promises that function soon.  Not even on an iPad.  This kind of limited use suggests the release of a product that should have waited several more months before introduction.  Fortunately, I have an iPhone.  There are other drawbacks -- I'll get to them at the end.  The iPhone app is relatively easy to use, although not elegant.To setting up the device is relatively easy, although you'll have to wait for 24 hours before the information starts getting sent to your device and alert email address.  All you need to do is download the free app, create your account, insert the included AAA battery, select the plant you will be monitoring from the database, insert the monitor into the soil, and wait.  Some people have complained that the information gathered is too vague; however, if your plant isn't getting enough light, just move it to a sunnier location and see whether that's enough.  If it needs more water, give it some, and if it's too wet, wait longer between waterings.  If it needs fertilizer, give it a dose and wait to see if it's enough.  The fact that this device CAN analyze soil fertility is pretty amazing.  Think about it.  Unless you are a master gardener with the proper tools, you are unlikely to be able to make more than an educated guess about whether your plant has enough food.The database of plants and information is large enough for most people.  I like that I entered \"Mona Lavender\", and the database came back with the correct hit, albeit in a different name:  Swedish Ivy.  The search function cross-references plant names, as long as you spell them correctly.  If you don't know the name of your plant, you won't be able to monitor it unless you assign a random plant to your garden.  You can monitor up to 256 Flower Power devices (imagine the cost!), one at a time, supposedly in sequence.Unfortunately, despite the potential of this device, it has some drawbacks besides the limited platform.  The device works using a Bluetooth connection, which limits the range.  If you put the Parrot outside or in a remote part of your house, you have to have your iPhone nearby and for long enough to receive the data.  Ideally, this device should be configured to work both over a home network AND via Bluetooth to a phone.  Because I'm monitoring a plant outside of my normal Bluetooth range (that's why I'm monitoring it -- I tend to forget about it), I don't always get the alerts in a timely manner that it needs water.  The GOOD part of the Bluetooth capabilities, however, is that you can monitor a plant far away from your computer.  I have a large property, and I can monitor a remote planting as long as I get close enough for the Flower Power to upload the data.  The instructions are a mess, too.  Instead of giving all instructions in English, then French, then Spanish, etc., the instructions give a little in English, then switch to the other languages, then back to English.  I had to weed through all the other languages to find the next set of information.  As a result, the set-up seemed much more complicated than it really was.I like this device a lot, although it could use improvements and enhancements.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"

        "text": "When I got a chance to review this product, I had read that an Android app would be available in January 2014. When I went to the Parrot website, however, they could only provide a signup to be notified when the Android version is available \"sometime in the first half of 2014.\" I'll have to update my actual experience with the monitor itself after the free Android app comes out. For those who already have Apple products, there's a free app that allows you to access the online plant database to monitor the needs of various types of plants and also read the sensor.This review is going to deal with my initial impressions only. First, I've used the early Easy Bloom product, which requires you to physically dump data onto your computer via a USB plug-in thingie. The Flower Power monitors more than the Easy Bloom (fertilizer needs!) and is wireless to boot. I didn't like how the Easy Bloom app was always \"on,\" hogging resources; I'm hoping the Flower Power will be different.Both products depend on accessing data from a web site, but I found Parrot's database to be a lot more accessible. Even without the app or the product hooked up, I was able to check out the database and will use it to help me plan what I plant this spring when, hopefully, I'll have the Android app. First, there's an A-to-Z sorter at the top of the page, and there are also great filters: Type (Grass, Interior Plants, Shrubs, Trees, Vines, Edibles), Shape/Habit, Bloom Color, Leaf Color, Lifetime (Annual, Biennial, Perennial), and Bloom Season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter). A search box not only finds what you look for, it tells you how many instances it found. So, for \"cucumbers,\" I got 33 varieties/hits; \"bush bean,\" 25 hits; \"bean,\" 68 hits, including bush beans, lima beans, regular old beans, plus anything that has \"bean\" in the common name, like Jacobean lily, Castor bean, Lucky bean tree, and Caribbean Red (pepper).Without the app, you can go to parrot/flowerpower and peruse the database to see how it's laid out. I found it very accessible and appealing, with its clear layout and wonderful photos, and it includes very helpful planting and plant care info, both hardiness and heat zones, even interesting facts about the plants&mdash;all in a very enjoyable-to-explore format. However, I realized quickly that the database is all in metric&mdash;which is Greek to most U.S. residents like me. (I left them a suggestion that they might want to at least put in a converter for those of us who just won't get with the metric program.)I'm really looking forward to planting tomatoes in my new Tomato Success Kits, which I can roll out into the sun in front of my apartment (the back's too shady), and I was at first delighted to see all the varieties (114 search hits!) of tomatoes (with great photos) in the database. But one problem immediately presented itself: the database does not include the super-essential (for container gardeners) indeterminate vs. determinate info for the tomatoes, so more research will be required once you've narrowed down your choices. I didn't spend a lot of time in the database looking at other edibles I might plant, but those who have specific veggies or fruits they wish to plant need to check them out to be sure the information they need is included. Of course, I'm sure the monitor itself could care less if a tomato is determinate or indeterminate. It's going to base its information on how much light, water, and fertilizer is there for the plant and also the temperature. It's up to container gardeners to figure out what's going to work in a planting.On the whole, so far I'm really impressed and hope that Android app is out in time for me to use the Flower Power this spring."

It comes in a cute package that makes a great gift idea. I am buying one for my mother for her birthday. When she comes over for coffee she is always asking how the plants are doing now.I loaded my plants, took a picture of them to set as their I.d. but you can use the stock photos.It gives me a graph for water, fertilizer, sunlight, and temperature. Graphs your plant up to a year.I found out I was watering my plants too much, now I only water when it says, the Flower power app gets a number on it when there are things to do, l also had to move my plants, as they were not getting enough sun. I can't wait to get to use this in the garden. You can use it on more than one plant, I switch mine between pots every 5-6 days, it still gives advice to care for the plant that its not currently in. It has a huge plant database, example there are 30 types of cucumbers, and 110 tomatoes, even though it doesn't have them all yet, it didn't have my Mimosa Pudica but I placed it under a similar fern. The database tells you if you can eat the plant or not, its life cycle, bloom color, leaf color, shape, height range, spread range, and long description and history along with watering needs, sunlight requirements, temperature zones, and how much fertilizer it needs. Planting instructions, growth habit, how it blooms and when you can harvest it. how to fertilizer and prune, what to do about pests and its climate zone. I would love to have a bunch of these, and I would love to be able to run from a Mac or PC I hope they get the cost down and sell them in a multi pack. I can only see this product getting better with time, it already did its own software update. I love it.Flower power update:I moved this to a vegetable bed further from the house and only control it with an wifi iPad.When you do this you have to go out to the flower power with Bluetooth on, collect your data then get back into wifi range and let it do a cloud analysis.It has worked through rain and shine, humid and hot weather. I water my plants a lot less now because even if it looks dry on top they have water at the roots.I also fertilize more often, but now I don't worry about it, I let the flower power tell me.I will either put this back up by the kitchen garden where it can catch the wifi or put the app back on the phone, I miss the auto updates but am curious how often it would be using the wifi if it had free rein.I really like this product.Have not needed to change batteries yet. Working on 4 months of continuous use as of this update."

Like, I would like to be riding the train home from the city and I suddenly get a text or notification like &#34;hey, you need to water the plants!&#34; I need this because I tend to forget and they tend to die. It doesn't work that way, though. Instead I have to open up the app, on my iPad (because that's where I installed it, although the app is designed for iPhone), stand close enough to the sensor to connect via bluetooth and see what it says. Well heck, if I remember to do that I guess I could remember to water. The first time it told me I needed to water, I saw that the (well, it's a tub of lawn grass I grow for my cats) was already sopping wet. I repositioned the sensor and that seemed to help and it's more accurate now, although I'm not really sure how much water to give when it says I need to water and when it tells me more light is needed well, 1.) I had to input a different variety of grass because mine wasn't listed, and mine is a shade-tolerant variety, so I'm not sure it's right and 2.) It's on a balcony and more light just aint gonna happen...at least not until summer. The grass LOOKS healthy, though.I'm a bit confused...if I'm told the plant isn't getting enough light, is that just RIGHT NOW...or am I getting an average from the whole day? I would like to be able to go in and tweak the parameters.The packaging for this is cute but it's WAY overpackaged. It's made to look like a flower growing in a box. If you're giving one as a gift, it would look nice. If you're buying yourself ten of them...annoying.Overall, I think this has some potential since at least the app can be updated at any time to be better...but the bluetooth is a limiting factor, unless I get some kind of firmware update that allows it to connect with my computer that has bluetooth and then from there send me and email or some kind of message when I'm away. Also, I should be able to use it on more than one device (like my iPad AND my iPhone) for the same Flower Power, since I'm sometimes using one and sometimes the other. Also...how well does the fertilizer thing actually work? I dunno...I love to play with weird gadgets and I definitely need help with plants, but I don't know how much I trust this thing."

Parrott says this will last 6 months, but in any case, AAA are simple and cheap.The app then installs easily, it&#8217;s pretty simple to sync via Bluetooth as long as its powered on for your device. The range is probably 10-15 feet. Before setting up a plant, you will need to register with Parrot. It&#8217;s then pretty easy to pick a plant from the list to monitor &#8212; in my case a Crassula ovata (Jade plant) &#8212; and then you&#8217;ll be able to read lots of suggestions on how to maintain your plant. Once my iPad mini is out of range though, you won&#8217;t be collecting continuous data. If you&#8217;re away from your home and aren&#8217;t syncing a device, don&#8217;t expect updates since the flower power doesn&#8217;t work over wifi. I have been prompted with a firmware update for the device, though it was never made clear what is being updated. Note this process took 5-10 minutes.After 12-24 hours, you&#8217;ll have interesting data and graphs on water, fertilizer, temperature, and light status. You can also get live data from the device, which is actually pretty cool (and at least I know the temperature reading is accurate.) The app pushes you heavily to monitor all your plants. This isn&#8217;t easy to do unless you purchase multiple devices for all the plants you have. The price for the device isn&#8217;t that outrageous, but it&#8217;s not a bargain either, and might only be good for those who are extremely meticulous about their gardens.I have not encountered any errors or problems with the device.

Second, the iPhone app is poorly designed at best and is in major need of an update to become more user friendly. Third, for $60, you are able to use the device with only ONE plant. If you wanted to expand this to all of the plants in your house, the price would be astronomical. If you have a really expensive plant that you feel needs the extra time and care that a $60 sensor with a poorly designed app will provide you, this may be the option for you.

        "text": "First of all, I may not be the market for this product, a beginner gardener.  I am an Extension Master Gardener, educated and certified by my state university and I teach horticulture classes.  As such, I am comfortable learning the conditions my plants need and whether I can meet them.  Perhaps this would be better for someone who has no clue as to whether something needs watering, but my use of this has made me not very trusting in its advice.The instruction sheet had several languages and was quite hard to follow.  I found the English, but it was not laid out in a manner that made any sense.I put this in a potted Meyer lemon tree that I keep indoors during the winter.  The plant should probably be repotted and I know the soil is not optimal. I fertilize it at appropriate times for the plant and its condition (over-fertilizing and over-watering kill most houseplants).  I was able to select the plant from the app's plant database.  It gave a little description of the care conditions.This takes 24 hours before you get the first real readings, which tell you if the plant has enough water, light and fertilizer.  It analyzes the fertilizer needs by checking the salts level.  I am not sure which salts it checks.  You can see a live analysis of all but the fertilizer and a chart telling you what the levels have been live and at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year increments.  I am not quite sure why the long history would be needed.The sensor checks the first few inches of the soil.  Depending on the plant, this may not be where most of the roots are, and the condition around the roots are what counts.  I had just watered the plant and it said the water was fine.  It said the plant needed fertilizer.  I don't think it does as it doesn't need a lot this time of year, but as I wanted to see how well this worked, I fertilized it with a liquid fertilizer, which should have hit the sensor.  The display continued to tell me I needed fertilizer until, after several days, I told it that I had done that.  This would not give a beginning gardener any indication if they had under- or over-fertilized.The database told me that Meyer lemons needed four (out of five) dots for the fertilization level.  The analysis does not use the same dot scale, but instead a 0-5.  The analysis is showing a very low level (about .5), but the &#34;to do&#34; list no longer shows it needs fertilizer.  I would much prefer a consistency between the recommendations and analysis.  The only factor that is consistent is the temperature, which is given in degrees on the plant care and analysis.My plant needs as much sun as I can give it indoors.  I have it in a south window, but the size of the plant makes it shade the sensor during parts of the day. Because of this, it tells me I don't get enough light.  I would be O.K. with this, but I know that part of the problem is that the sensor is shaded by plant leaves as the sun moves.  I had to tell it I moved the plant and the warning went away.  It hasn't come back and I didn't really move anything, so I don't have a lot of confidence in this.It is telling me my water is fine, (again, the analysis is %, but the plant care guide shows water drops), but by looking at it I can tell it needs watering.  The live monitor says the level is at 17% and the plant care recommendation says the plant needs two (out of five) water drops.  I am going to give it another day and see if it tells me to water, but my experience tells me I should be watering it today.Ideally this could be used for a week or two for a gardener to learn the needs of a plant, then moved to another plant or turned off.  However, the fact that I can't trust what it is telling me makes me unlikely to recommend it.  Sorry."

Though the Parrot only currently works with specific iOS devices.However, for the price it may be worth it to you to use it like I do - to establish a baseline routine.  I monitor a plant for a couple of weeks (during different seasons and sunlight locations) to get a more precise idea of how often certain plants need to be watered and fertilized.  After I think I have a feel for it, I move the Parrot to the next new or unhealthy plant for a few weeks to get metrics for that one.For the most part the feedback from the Parrot hasn't been much different than visual cues from the plant, but it has definitely changed my schedule with plants that are less-expressive of distress, like cactus, bamboo, violets, etc."

I'll update this a bit more once the Android app is released (1H14).First off, this is way more than a water/moisture sensor, it's a rather comprehensive tool for understanding your plants, and the included app software takes it even further.  The next thing that becomes apparent is that despite how well thought out it is for a first generation product, it is just that.  Bluetooth is great, but the range is hit or miss, and you need to manually sync things.  Certainly not a deal breaker, but an opportunity for improvement.  The aforementioned Android app is another (though that's as much an issue with Android's Bluuetooth 4.0 support), but the iOS app is rather nice.  The database does make it easy to find your plants, which is what makes this more than a sensor--the analysis that's based on your plant type.Pros:Senses moisture, temperature, light, and fertilizer levelsSpecies based analysisEasy to use appGood battery lifeBluetooth 4.0 (helps with the good battery life)Weatherproof (as you'd expect, but still a positive)Cons:No current Android support (largely an Android issue with Bluetooth 4.0)Spotty Bluetooth range and connectionsMust manually syncA bit pricey for one sensorThis certainly isn't for everyone, though if you're in the market for smart plant sensors (not sure what else is out there), this is a rather well thought out device.

I've found, too, that I can move it from plant to plant every couple of weeks or so to monitor more than one. During the summer, I will give it a try outdoors, as well.The iPhone app could use a little streamlining, but it does work well. One has to set it up for each plant, but once a plant has been saved it's can be recalled. Today, the app called for a firmware update to the Flower Power unit, which was done through my iPhone with no hassle. The app also suggested I move my cacti collection to a sunnier window, but that's not an option. However, when the sun finally came in through that window, the app assumed I'd moved it.This sensor is for those who, like me, have difficult locations, especially during the winter, when it's not possible to move plants outside for a little extra sunshine. It is also interesting to see in real time how a plant is faring. I recommend getting a unit if you're concerned about the day-to-day health of your potted plants."

First off, this works well at keeping the mosquitos (and gnats!) at bay, as I knew it would. I hear them buzzing around me while I'm gardening and hiking, but I don't get bitten. Mind you, I'm someone who will get bitten within 2 minutes of going outside, so this is really saying something.

I love the fact that it is easy to forget that I have this on because it truly does dry quickly. Also, the smell is not overpowering. When I hug my repellent-covered kids, I only get a faint whiff of smell rather than an overpowering nose full.The only reason I won't give this five stars is because we have not tested the ten-hour claim.

Although I prefer natural formulations, they tend not to last as long as commercial applications and the constant reapplication is inconvenient and annoying. This spray contains 25% DEET and a promise to repel the blood suckers for up to ten hours. It is sweat resistant.Unlike many commercial preparations, this one was dry in a matter of seconds. The odor was pleasantly light and quickly disappeared. It was not sticky or oily. I spent a good six  hours outside working to prepare an area for my garden. I was happily undisturbed by insects and didn't smell like a walking citronella stick. I experienced no side effects and was generally pleased with its performance.Care must be taken when spraying on material other than cotton, wool and nylon. It may damage leather and synthetics as well as impact watch crystals, painted or varnished surfaces and plastics. This is unfortunate because when walking my dogs through wooded areas, I like to spray repellant on my boots or shoes and clothes to discourage hitchhikers. Be careful when applying to children and avoid using near the eyes, and mouth. Use your hands to administer to your face.Overall, this is an effective and reliable repellant. It sprays without clogging and I appreciated the ease with which the cap locked by rotating. It is unnoticeable when wearing with no repulsive odor or unpleasant feel. I liked the single application and think this is a fine choice for people who spend large amounts of time outdoors, whether for work or play. Recommended."

And one of the brands I have used and trusted for years is Cutter.This particular brand, Cutter Backwoods Dry, is new for me but I found that it works as good or better than other insect repellants. The best quality of this bug spray, by far, is the fact that it goes on dry. There is no sticky residue and you don&#8217;t smell as bad as when you use those other sprays.  Okay, it isn&#8217;t perfectly dry, but it does dry completely in a very short time and there is a noticeable difference between this brand and others.As for its ability to repel the biting insects, Cutter Backwoods Dry works quite well. I sprayed myself, walked out into the backyard where I could visibly see the mosquitoes in the air, and I wasn&#8217;t touched by any of them. I could see them and they would get close to my skin, but wouldn&#8217;t land. It was like an invisible barrier was placed around my body. No bites, no itching, and no problems.I don&#8217;t spend as much time outside as other people I know, but I do venture into the great outdoors on occasion and I need some protection. I don&#8217;t tend to attract mosquitoes the way some people do, but they will still come after me if no one else is around and Cutter Backwoods Dry is a good product to keep the little buggers away."

The standard &#34;non dry&#34; formula comes in 7.5 and 11 oz cans and is much less expensive per ounce.  Currently the 6 oz is only $4.00 on Amazon, so almost double the spray for half the price.  Yes, this goes on &#34;dryer&#34; and has a bit less scent, but not worth double the price.  And yes, 25% DEET is going to work well on repelling mosquitoes and ticks.  Caution:  One reviewer asked if they should spray it on their pets... this is not recommended for them because they will lick it off their coat and this is NOT for internal use.So yes it works and it's expensive.  It dries quickly and leaves less of a scent that other insect repellents (aka pesticides)... and the locking cap is a great design so it won't go off in your backpack.  I used this on a warm summer night when mosquitoes were buzzing about and it definitely kept them at bay... but then I took a shower once I returned inside to wash this stuff off.Now let's talk about DEET for a minute and also discuss alternatives...DEET was created by the United States Army in World War II for jungle warfare.  It was originally tested as a pesticide on crops, entering civilian use in 1957 and enjoying widespread use during the Vietnam War.  This is serious stuff which is why this is listed as &#34;backwoods&#34; meaning you don't just use this for a day in the park with your family.  This is if you are doing some serious trekking or if you're in a malarial or high West Nile region where a mosquito bite can be dangerous.The June 2014 Consumer Reports has a good spread on insect repellents and includes a sidebar titled &#34;Insect repellents: choose carefully&#34; where it discusses the dangers of DEET including &#34;seizures, slurred speech and coma after people have ingested it or applied it for more than 3 days in a row...&#34; and says the higher the DEET concentration the more risk.  So just because this is in a pretty green can you shouldn't spray it all over everything in sight especially your kids.. and I personally wouldn't use this on any child except as a last resort.  The CDC says not to use this on any child under 3.  I would quadtruple that at least.  Consumer Reports recommends &#34;Off Family Care Smooth and Dry&#34; which is only 15% DEET and also lists some more natural alternatives, such as repellents with 20% picaridin.You might want to try &#34;Cutter Advanced 6-Ounce 7-Percent Picaridin Insect Repellent Pump Spray&#34; which as of this writing is kid-friendly and works GREAT for us... we used it all over Bali, Indonesia where the mosquitoes are like fire-fueled vampires and it kept them at bay.  If you're just sitting in your backyard or at a camp get some citronella candles / torches to help keep the biting bugs at bay.So do your homework and only use this stuff as a last resort and be really careful about applying it to children.  I don't mean to be alarmist ... but from some of the reviews I've read it's apparent to me that some aren't really taking the precautions and warnings on the label seriously.  And people wonder why we have a cancer epidemic in this country... go more natural if you can and only bring out the big insecticide bomb if nothing else works!  And DO NOT spray this on your pet!! Please!Hope this helps and happy trekking and camping!"

        "text": "First, I want to acknowledge that Cutter works--it works very well indeed and is an effective repellant. And where I live in Connecticut the deer-tick population is massive and those ticks carry Lyme disease (which I've had, it's miserable--it settled in my knees) and so I fully understand why people turn to products like Cutter to protect themselves. And I *do* use it myself on rare occasion when I know that I'm in a tick-infested area like a wet marsh or meadow. And yes, Cutter does work and probably as well as any other brand.I'm giving it only three stars, however, because the chemical that makes this product work is DEET which is a much more dangerous chemical than manufacturers would lead us to believe. It must be used sparingly and should NEVER be used on babies or very young children. It's far better to cover up the skin that to bomb it with chemicals. Also, remember that there are many natural insect repellants (look them up online, there is a lot written about them) and I grow several scented geranium plants in my container garden every summer to use for repelling mosquitos. Lemon-scented geranium is very simple to grow in a pot and breaking off a few leaves and rubbing them on your skin works very well. Also, you can still buy \"punks\" in some stores and online and if you're just sitting in the yard or in a park/beach, burning a few inexpensive punks will give all the protection you need.So, am I just being paranoid or is DEET actually dangerous? Well, here is what the EPA says on their site:Read and follow all directions and precautions on this product label.Do not apply over cuts, wounds, or irritated skin.Do not apply to hands or near eyes and mouth of young children.Do not allow young children to apply this product.Use just enough repellent to cover exposed skin and/or clothing.Do not use under clothing.Avoid over-application of this product.After returning indoors, wash treated skin with soap and water.Wash treated clothing before wearing it again.Use of this product may cause skin reactions in rare cases. The following additional statements will appear on the labels of all aerosol and pump spray formulation labels:Do not spray in enclosed areas.To apply to face, spray on hands first and then rub on face. Do not spray directly onto face.My suggestion with products like Cutter is to spray it on your clothing and not on your skin. Tie a kerchief around your neck and spray that and it will protect your face quite a bit.I'm not trying to trash Cutter here, by the way. I gave the three stars because the product does indeed work quite well. But it would be irresponsible of me to say, sure, slather this on, without acknowledging that there are dangers. I have downgraded it two stars because I think these companies should acknowledge the dangers more--particularly for babies and children. But if you use it sparingly when you are in infested areas and if you wash up afterwards, it's probably an acceptable risk for adults. Lyme disease and West Nile are terrible things and I would have to say the risk of DEET dangers is probably low by comparison--but that does not make it 100% safe. Do some online research and draw your own conclusions. I will carry this Cutters with me (I like the dry-spray, by the way, that's not just hype, it's far less oily) and, when the situation is desperate, I will apply it."

The biggest negative might be the cost which is rather expensive.  However, when considering the consequences of not using adequate protection against mosquito viruses, cost is not a factor.If you are working outdoors and sweat profusely like some people I know, the longer lasting and stronger the better - as long as your skin will tolerate it.One problem I've had when I spray my face is DEET running into my eyes carried by perspiration.  I spray a Terry Cloth head band with Permethrin and wear a broad brim hat treated the same.  That seems to work better for me anyway.I've used most every mosquito repellant there is.  Some are better than others, however, even with the best, if you miss a spot, the little blood-suckin' buggers will find it.I spend a good deal of time outdoors during the summer months - and in Georgia - mosquito repellant is a necessity.For years, I have used the 40% Deet formula advertised for those who enjoy living in swamps and jungles.100% Deet causes a burning sensation on my skin.  It doesn't blister or cause a rash but it is uncomfortable.Clinical studies have proven that some people have an allergy to 100% Deet.I have an old military buddy in Maine who had to go to the hospital because he used too much 100% Deet on a fishing trip.As if West Nile Virus was not bad enough, in 2014, we have a new mosquito-borne Chikungunya Virus to worry about in the USA.  There is no vaccine and no cure.  It can last for 3 years and the joint pain can be excruciating.My formula is simple.  I apply a liberal amount of Permethrin to my clothing until damp. Sawyer Permethrin will last for several washings.  Don't worry if it accidentally contacts your skin.  It is harmless to your skin but it does lose its effectiveness.Next, I spray every bit of exposed skin with Deet repellant.  My face, ears, and neck especially appreciate the gentle kindness shown by Cutter Dry Backwoods 25%.Okay, maybe I do spray twice as much 25% as I do the 40%, but it feels twice as good after it dries.Auto makers use crash test dummies to determine the safety of their cars.I need a dummy other than myself that I can sit out in the back yard and fill will poison fake plasma and CO2 and let the mosquitoes suck on him until they die.Wouldn't that be better than a $350.00 propane mosquito trap that's only 50% effective?"

Mosquitoes and ticks are horrible when the weather gets warm and rainy. I treat my clothing with Permethrin, but on any exposed skin I use bug spray. I dislike the smell and the greasy residue which results in me not using enough of it and still getting a few mosquito bites. I was happy to try the Cutter backwoods version (I had been using a different brand).I have used the Cutter&#8217;s on several four-hour hikes and have not had any mosquito bites or picked up any ticks. There were a lot of mosquitoes and bugs flying around but none landed on me. Just to be sure this wasn&#8217;t a fluke, I used the other brand (a non-deep woods version with a lesser amount of deet) and after less than an hour had two itchy mosquito bites.I have sensitive skin so am always worried that a new-to-me product will cause irritation, but I was fine I had no skin reactions using the Cutter Backwoods formula (although I do wash off the spray as soon as I get home).The Cutter spray proved to be a superior product. In addition to keeping away the bugs, it&#8217;s pleasant to use. It goes on dry and has a mild scent. The nozzle produces a steady, even spray and doesn&#8217;t leak. Plus it locks in place when closed so I don&#8217;t have to worry about it leaking in my bag or in the car."

I just can't stand the sticky / oily feel most bug repellents, so I was happy to be able to try Cutters Backwoods.Well, it was love at first spray.  The product dispenses easily, and indeed feels dry; NO sticky or moist feeling from this stuff.  But the biggest question - does it keep the bugaboos away?  YES - it works great.

I have tried many bug sprays in the past and while they worked to a point, I was always left sticky, smelly and not 100% protected. It seemed like a lot of hassle to just be outside. My answer is to always choose the indoor activity.I decided to give Cutter a chance. It went on less wet than others. I suppose I was expecting it to go on like a powder but it wasn't quite that dry. It did evaporate fast and didn't leave me feeling sticky. The smell wasn't something I would choose in a perfume, but it wasn't as chemical as others that I've tried. It also didn't linger quite as much.I found it to do a decent job with the bugs. I feel like I must be like candy to mosquitos. They will pass by all others in my family to go right for me. The spray worked more for them than me. However, I do not follow the suggestions of wearing light colored, loose clothing either. So this might have something more to do with it.All in all, this worked better than others for me and I'd choose to purchase it if I was looking at a shelf of choices in the store."

So the questions after that are, what does it smell like, how well does it feel on the skin, and what's the price. On those counts, the Cutter Backwoods is quite good: the aroma wasn't bad (better than Deepwoods Off in my opinion), it goes on wet and then dries very quickly on the skin, without leaving any noticeable residue (especially not an oily residue), and the price (shipped by amazon) doesn't seem ridiculous.I have a small squirt bottle of 100% DEET which is unpleasant, but works well.

EWG has a nice write-up on DEET usage and concentration levels.I've found the product to be completely effective when mountain biking. I don't come home with any ticks, whereas the people who didn't apply do have them crawling on their bodies. I'd rather use the repellent than risk Lyme disease.As with any product containing DEET, use caution what you spray it near. Higher concentrations of DEET will eat through plastics."

It goes on wet but dries almost instantly and leaves behind only a light scent that fades quickly.  It's much better than being savaged by mosquitoes, disease-carrying or not.We both prefer to spray it on our clothes - a little on our t-shirts, a spritz at the ankles and knees (because for some reason, mosquitoes always go for my knees, right through the jeans). This works just fine as long as you're wearing cotton (DEET eats synthetics and is supposed to be hard on leather, too. If I spray a dab on my wrists on extra skeetery nights, I'm careful to keep it off my watch and other jewelry, though I don't know if it can affect it.  If they're buzzing near my face, I spray my wrist then use my finger to put dots of repellent on my neck and face.This is the first spray we've felt okay about using.

It lasts a long time (half to a whole day without reapplication versus every few hours with traditional spray) and can withstand a little sweat (although I'd never say it is sweat resistant).  Instead of a snap on cap that inevitably gets lost or cracked, the cap twists slightly to cover/uncover the spray nozzle.  My only complaint is the spray nozzle gets clogged after a few uses.  Generally running warm water over it unclogs it, but not always.  In those cases, you are throwing away a half filled can of product which really stinks."

Spray it on, and you won't be bitten by mosquitoes for about ten hours. However, Deet, the active ingredient, should not be taken lightly. There are warnings about not using it on young children and elderly adults, and users are advised to shower after using it .I have come to the conclusion that this is a product for people on camping or hiking trips (it also protects against ticks), rather than back porch yarn spinners."

However, at 25% concentration, according to my research, it will probably not repel mosquitoes for the claimed 10 hours. According to a study by the Journal of the American Mosquito Control Association, &#34;DEET formulations (20%-34%) offered 3&#8211;6 hours of protection.&#34; There is also some health questions about using DEET directly on the skin, especially on children (you should do your own research on these issues). I tend to use more natural substances directly on my skin (mainly a citronella oil mix) and limit the use of products such as this to only my clothing. Also, I tend not to wear dark clothing, which attracts mosquitoes more than lighter-colored clothing. It's also good to avoid wearing fragrances or using perfumed shampoo or soap before going outside.This product is great when used with care and realistic expectations. If you plan a long day out in the woods or at the time of year when mosquitoes are plentiful, carry this or other repellents with you to apply every few hours. Keep in mind that if you are sweating from work or play (sweat also attracts mosquitoes), you may need to apply this product more often."

So, I thought if I could keep the birds from sitting on the top of my fence and provide them with another (safer) place to wait it would be a win, win.The strips are easy to install.  Each pre-drilled section is only 2 ft. long and because they are made of plastic, there are no sharp edges.  And since they are made of clear plastic, they will never rust and they blend right into the background so they're almost invisible.  My husband thinks they will become leaf magnets in the Fall but hopefully they won't be too difficult to clean.  As far as durability is concerned, only time will tell.

        "text": "While I respect all wildlife, there are times when the prudent human draws a line that specifies that it is best that the wildlife be on one side and humans be on the other. So it is true with pigeons, who are known to carry diseases that are very harmful to humans. They also leave a mess where they roost. In my climate pigeons tend to make their homes in areas that help to keep them out of the hot sun. I don't wish to harm them, only to discourage them from roosting in certain areas where their droppings have the potential of spreading disease or disfiguring the exterior walls of the house. In my house there are really only 2-3 such areas, one of them right over the front entrance door.Previously we had used \"chicken wire\" to prevent the pigeons from roosting in these areas.  However it is unattractive and it is possible the birds could become enmeshed in the wire, which is not the intent.During a recent whole-home remodel in which the exterior was repainted, we removed all of the chicken wire and added Bird B Gone spikes in the two areas in which pigeon droppings could potentially fall on children, guests or food.  We started with the stainless steel spikes and also wanted to compare the Lucite spikes which cost less.  This review compares the two.Despite the fact that the Lucite spikes are clear, the stainless steel spikes actually call less attention to themselves. Both have pointy ends that discourage unwanted guests from roosting but neither would be considered harmful or lethal to wildlife as they are more of a deterrent.The pro for the metal spikes is that they are shiny and wave in the wind which makes noise, all of which discourage the birds before they even get near. The downside of that is that the vibration can get a little annoying to humans in the house. For any given length they are a bit lighter than the plastic version.  Another downside is that the cost is quite a bit more.The pro for the plastic spikes is that they cost less and are equally as effective. They are very rigid and do not vibrate. But the clear material is also shiny and will most likely discourage a bird before it even comes close. I tried to break off a spike of the plastic variety and it did not break easily. Time will tell which best survives harsh weather conditions (I will update this review if I find any huge advantages of one over the other).A couple of final observations ...1. Installation with glue is much easier than installing with screws. Nobody wants to make screw holes in their roof nor glue anything to it but it's a necessary evil and let's face reality, most people will never remove bird spikes once they are installed.2. If you use glue be sure to put a dollop of glue where each screw hole is. The glue will ooze through the hole and act as a very strong screw to help hold the strip down.3. Be sure to let the spikes hang over the edge of the mounting surface 1 - 2\". This will help discourage the birds before they start to roost.4. Try mounting the strip with the spikes pointing out rather than up (this works especially well with the plastic strips). This mounting will be just as effective with almost no risk of harming the bird or catching debris.  In my installation it also makes the Lucite plastic spikes much less visible from street level.If birds are a nuisance or potential health hazard where you live, bird spikes can be a worthwhile way of telling the birds to seek shelter elsewhere without harming them. Bird B Gone seems to own the residential market for such products (although there are many, more expensive, solutions) and they are reasonably well made. They are not cheap but after all this is one of those expenses you do once and shouldn't have to think about again for many years down the road."

The bird is quite noisy very early in the morning and I fight her off with a broom (destroying only bits of straw and such--never the bird, a built nest, or eggs) but still she persists. I've tried many things to keep her away (box covered in foil being my ugliest invention) and this is the perfect solution! Inexpensive enough for anyone, this is doing the trick. I'm so glad I found this product. The spikes aren't sharp enough to injure the animal (they are plastic) but are enough to deter her from thinking that my AC unit is a proper place for her little ones. Love, love, love this item!!"

I had tried everything I could think of with very limited success and most things I used were  very unattractive. These spikes are not bad looking and they do keep the birds away but unfortunately &#34;my birds&#34; just moved to another spot. Don't get me wrong...I think these spikes are GREAT and the birds hate them. Just be prepared to use more spikes than you might expect because you'll have to put them in every possible roosting place the birds can find! Being made of plastic made it easy to trim them to fit in every possible nook and light enough in weight that I could glue them in place. I would highly recommend them for anyone who has pesky birds that just won't take no for an answer!"

In fact they can protect birds by keeping their nests away from dangerous areas.For the past few years birds have tried to nest in a hanging flower basket by my front door. The one year they succeeded and laid eggs, every time the door opened or someone came up on the porch they flew away in a panic, swinging the basket and in the process lost an egg. This wasn't too pleasant for any of the humans that got near it either. I also had birds try to nest in the rafters under my deck where they then panicked anytime someone stepped out on to it.These spikes solved that problem. I had previously been using plastic forks. These look better and are also more effective. I used a bolt cutter to snap the 10 foot spikes into smaller pieces that would fit into the under deck areas. They really did not break/snap into shorter lengths. I also used screws and an electric screwdriver to fasten them which was better than trying to drive nails. I put a small piece in my hanging basket and covered the base of it with potting soil after securing it with toothpicks.The result is the birds have found better places and the humans are happier too."

These act like fingers to do the work of pulling and mixing for you.So for example if you wish to toss a salad, this even helps ensure you don't have oversized bites.  It allows you to grab and mix flawlessly.If you want to mix something into a dish like dressing into pasta salad or seasoning and bread crumbs into meatloaf, this gives you better mixing and gripping capabilities.But the claws are what make the difference for pulled protein.  It's now simple to shred your meat in order to serve over potatoes or in sandwiches or breakfast tacos or atop tortillas.And then the veggie households can use it equally as well to toss a salad or their pasta.It's like a combo of lots of forks and knives put together, ala Edward Scissorhandsmeat claws provided by kashaReview is my unbiased opinion"

These prongs are wider and are far more efficient at shredding the meat without getting clogged up.They are very comfortable to hold and easy to maintain a good grip even when your hands get greasy. I was able to get through a rather large pork roast in less than half the time it usually takes me, and the end result was also more uniform.One tip: don't throw away the box they come in. The tips on these are very sharp -- even though they are made of plastic, they can puncture your skin if you reach for them in a drawer. Save the box and use that for storage.Cleanup is very easy -- just rinse under hot water. They are also dishwasher safe. The underside of the claws are hollow, but I didn't have any problems cleaning them under a strong stream of hot water.If you make pulled pork these are a must-have.  Highly recommend![Sample provided for review]"

Those are probably better for lifting rather that flipping and shredding.  These meat claws have six sturdy tines and even though they aren&#8217;t made of metal, do a great job shredding meat.  They also work well for holding down a piece of meat while slicing.I haven&#8217;t tried scooping charcoal in or out of the grill, but no doubt they would work well for that.  The tines themselves are approximately 1-3/4&#8221; long and the entire &#8220;paw&#8221; is a full 4-1/4&#8221; wide.  The tips of the tines are quite sharp and easily stab and hold anything I tried.  The plastic is quite solid and I was easily able to grip and work them both in tandem.  No learning curve here.If you are into pork pulling and are no pro with a couple of forks, these will work quite nicely.  I even tried using them as mixers and even though they are shorter than a salad fork and spoon set, they worked quite well.  Actually a bit better because I was able to toss a salad quickly and easily.  Less lettuce and salad fixings were rolling off to the side because these claws are wide.  A bit of an unconventional use for the Kassa Meat Claws, but whatever works.There are probably a ton of uses for the Kassa claws and I saw a couple of interesting suggestions on the box.  For example, one was for grabbing potatoes out of the oven.  I don&#8217;t know how many times I&#8217;ve burned my fingers snagging baked potatoes out of the oven.  I think the Kassa Meat Claws, which aren&#8217;t solely for use with meats, will be making their way into my cupboard to try next time there&#8217;s a turkey in the oven.Sample provided for review."

These claws are the best thing to come along for that task than anything I can remember.When I was offered a review sample I thought they were cast iron - it turns out they are nylon, but are as strong as any metal utensils I have used. They are relatively light, rigid, but with a little give, and the pair of them can easily withstand the weight of a ten pound piece of meat (the largest size I tried lifting with them.)While these are excellent for lifting and transporting meat, they were designed to shred it and that they do. Once you get the hang of using them - a very slight learning curve - you can shred meat like a hungry raptor. There is sufficient room between the handle portion and the claws to keep you from burning or scalding your knuckles as long as you hold them perpendicular to the meat while you are working on it. Coming at a large piece of meat from a lesser angle can blister your knuckles. Also, the claws are pretty sharp and require the same level of respect as a razor sharp knife. But if you exercise caution and common sense these are completely safe.Although they are of nylon they will not easily melt. They can withstand 450 degrees F, so they are dishwasher safe. I will caution you to thoroughly clean them with a strong jet of water on the back side because there are channels behind the claws that can collect meat. Even if you machine wash them, take care to remove meat from that part of the claws because that is a weak point from a sanitary perspective. Again, common sense and diligent attention to sanitation will prevent problems.I tried these out the same day they arrived and am impressed. So nuch so that I intend to recommend a pair to family and friends because they and not only handy, but essential if you prepare shredded or pulled barbeque."

        "text": "This solar-powered light system has a lot to recommend it, and just a couple of flaws.  Let&#8217;s start with the good:1. It&#8217;s amazingly bright, for a solar-powered system.  Anyone who has installed the old-style solar powered outdoor lights knows that they are bright enough to show people where the lights are, but not exactly useful in providing actual illumination.  The d.light system isn't as bright as an incandescent bulb (or a CF, for that matter), but it does a reasonable job of lighting the area.  And since the cords between the lights and the controllers are long, you can spread them out to light a wider area or mass them to create more intense light.2. The lights are individually controlled and each one has a high power/low power option, so you can decide for yourself how to choose between brightness and the length of time your system will function without a recharge.3. The system is advertised as providing light for a long time.  One light on low power operates for 15 hours.  Operating both lights high power, the system operates for 3.5 hours.  But even that is a pretty long time if, for instance you are lighting a cabin, tent or garden shed.  Also, the lights glowed brightly even with just a couple of hours of sun.4. It is simple to install; all you need is a drill and screwdriver to install the 10 screws.  The instructions consist of three pictures and about that many some self-evident sentences. But that&#8217;s all you need.The flaws are minor, but  worth mentioning:1. It&#8217;s fairly pricey.  At $185, this system is worthwhile only if it&#8217;s going to last a while. Otherwise, you are better off hanging an LED-powered flashlight with rechargeable batteries from the ceiling. The system is guaranteed for two years, but since this is a new product, there&#8217;s no telling how long it will actually last.2. There is no mounting hardware. One would think that it would not be too difficult for the manufacturer to add the include screws to fasten the solar panel, the four screws to attach the two controllers and the two screws for the lights. It also wouldn't be too difficult to include cable staples to hold the wires in place, which are conveniently pictured in the instructions but inconveniently not included in the package. Did I mention that the system is pricey?On the whole, this is a good product for lighting a shed, exterior garage or a one-room summer cabin."

        "text": "The d.light D20 Solar Home System (SHS) Kit can be a valuable solar home system.  It comes with a solar panel, 2 LED lamps (high & low settings), an independent portable lantern that is quite bright on the high setting, and a power pack to charge mobile phones via a USB jack (6 adaptors included).We put the solar panel on the roof near the back of the house, the east side, where it gets lots of sunshine.  Plugging the LED lights into the control unit there is ample cord to extend the lights to the extremities of our 30 foot long deck.  We let the unit charge all of one day before trying it and it worked perfectly.  The lights lit up the deck area sufficiently to read outside if you wish, and the lantern was bright enough to light areas of the yard as we walked.However, the 2nd night we had a heavy snowfall accompanied by freezing rain and the unit put out very little power.  I suppose it is similar to all solar panels and subject to that limitation.  As the weather breaks this SHS will be moved to the back of our lot to light the storage sheds.  That is where this will be really helpful.  Lighting an area that is almost in total darkness with no streetlights around.  I will try to find a way to shelter the solar panel from heavy snow and ice during winter times, but its primary usage will be in spring, summer, and fall for yard work and home construction projects.By the way, the lantern included in this kit has several reviews on its own on Amazon.com.  The reviews are quite positive, which was my initial experience.  I am hopeful the lantern and the lights will decrease the activity of varmints in our back yard garden.  Electricity rates are too high to leave lights on all night, but the solar powered unit will eliminate those costs."

        "text": "Since building my tool shed last month, I've been looking for several lighting options that didn't require electrical hard wiring. I've been using lanterns with some degree of success. The opportunity to test the d.light D20 solar lighting system was most welcome. Down here on the coast, I knew getting enough sun would not be a problem for this unit. After almost two weeks use, these are my thoughts on this product.After reading over the instructions I took a brief inventory and inspection of the components. This kit includes (1) solar panel, (2) hanging LED light fixtures (2) wall switches, (1) LED lantern, (1) controller, (1) 20' cable, (4) electronic device adapters, (1) lantern cable and instructions. The company tags on a two year product replacement warranty. With the exception of the battery, the components for this lighting system are made of ABS. The initial set up went smooth. Instructions are easy to understand.A big plus is that the solar panel has holes for mounting. In no time I had it installed on the roof of my shed. The 20' cable was more then long enough to marry up with the controller. Afterwards I installed the two hanging LED lights in the rafters and mounted the wall switches. I hung the controller directly above my work bench. The wall switches have both a bright and dim setting. I also like the option of being able to operate the lights from the controller. All of the cables are fitted with jacks.It didn't even take a full 8 hours before I had enough juice in to operate the lights. The controller can also be charged via an AC adapter which for some odd reason was not included. No worries I had one that married up well with this unit. I'm glad the designer mounted an easy to read battery level indicator on the face of this box. In no time the lantern was at full charge. Its brighter then I thought it would be. I hung it on my tool rack for that extra bit of light. I was also able to charge all three of our cell phones without any issues.The true test came when I left these lights on the dim setting overnight. At 5 am the next morning I was pleasantly surprised to find that these puppies were still operating. This lightning system has been doing the job ever since. That's good enough for me. This is the first semi-portable solar lighting unit that I've run in to that has worked as advertised. Its more then capable of holding its own. The folks at Dlight got this one right."

        "text": "I'm rating it 4 stars for the build quality, not usefulness or value for money.The product was much better built than I expected. It's mostly plastic, but feels solid, not cheap and flimsy.There are a few parts to the package. There's the panel (5W max. output), the combination charge controller / battery pack / output regulator, capacity unspecified. There are two wired lamps with switches, and one cordless lantern with its own rechargeable battery (capacity unspecified).The panel has mounting holes so that it can be fixed on a outdoor surface, and is the only part that is rated for outdoor use. All the other parts are for indoor use only.It appears to be meant for use at home, which is a rather strange proposition. The wired lights are rather weak for home use. They're bright enough for my weak eyes to read from 4 feet away at the low setting, but they're extremely weak compared to even a 40W incandescent bulb. It comes with 2 lights (each with its own switch) and you can add 2 more if you like. According to the manual, you can run 2 lights on high for 7 hours, or on low for 15 hours. With 4 lights, your runtime is cut down to 3.5 hours and 9 hours respectively.The lantern can run for 5 hours on high, and 10 hours on low. It is surprisingly light. It is charged through the USB port, but requires a special cable that ends in a very thin barrel plug. I wish it has a mini or micro USB port on it for charging instead. There are no indicators on it to show how much charge is remaining. The translucent diffuser can be unscrewed and removed if you prefer. Even at the high setting, it is noticeably dimmer than the wired light at its low setting.There doesn't appear to be an easy way of taking the charge controller / battery pack apart. No screws. This will be a problem when the batteries start to degrade. I'm not sure what batteries are in it, but there's space for 4 18650 (for about 20Wh of power). This sounds about right for a 5W solar panel.You can charge any USB device from the USB port. A cable with multiple tips is included, but you can always use your own USB cable instead.I can see this being more useful if you have a shed that's not wired for electricity. For home use, unless you're planning for power failure, you're much better off getting low wattage LED bulbs if your aim is to save money. It can come in useful if you're camping somewhere remote and don't want to carry enough batteries or USB battery packs to last that long.Again, in conclusion, a well built package that's complete and easy to set up, but unless you have a shed that doesn't have power, it probably isn't too useful at home. I wish the charge controller / battery pack is sealed for outdoors use, because that could have been very useful - a solar powered Arduino project with battery backup sounds quite exciting."

Once again, in my current residence, I will probably only use it in emergency situations.  The kit includes a lantern exactly like I previously purchased.  It is not extremely bright, but it emits enough light for my needs.  I keep them in window sills so that they are always charged when needed.  I would have more uses (other than emergency) if the wall lights were water proof.  I would love to use the 2 included lights and add 2 additional lights (maximum recommended) and place them on my house outside in some dark areas.  The only piece that is recommended for outdoor use is the solar panel itself.  I can see how this kit would be an excellent option for a shed, playhouse, treehouse, or garage that is away from the house and does not have electric.

        "text": "The uses for this are pretty broad. Any building without power, such as a shed or storage building. As attic lighting - if you have a window. Camping, inside a trailer - really anywhere you have access to the sun. Since it is solar, weather, trees, snow and amount and intensity of available light is important. In Utah, you'll get a full charge in 8 hours. In Chicago? Closer to 12 hours. But since most people will only use this for a few minutes at a time - or even a few hours - I doubt 95% of owners will ever run the battery dry.The kit includes the solar panel, battery pack, two lights with switches and a lantern.  Additional lights can be purchased - the battery pack supports four lights. The battery pack also has a USB port - this charges the lantern or any other device that can be charged from a USB port. Smart phone, etc.  The battery pack can also be used stand-alone to charge your phone, tablet, etc. Everything hooks up to the battery pack with jacks, so nothing is permanently attached to it.My one complaint/peeve. They have tried to keep everything as simple and reliable as possible. Everything is modular. That means that the wires, distance to switches, battery pack - it's all fixed.  You can loop up extra wire (ugly) or cut and tape (voids warranty.) Same thing with extending the cable.  Apart from that complaint, it's a darn good system.  Most people won't even be bothered by that.The switches are large flaps - push to turn on, again to change brightness, again to turn off. Simple enough.  They are not waterproof, so don't think of using these for outdoors. You can also turn on and off from the battery pack and pre-set the switches to dim or bright. So you can press one button (on the battery) and turn on all the lights.  This essentially gives you a third, master switch.  Hang the pack near the entrance and you have instant light.The battery fully charges from the solar panel in 8 hours. You can also charge it from AC with a 12V (.5 amp minimum) adapter. It's not included (I save all my adapters and found a few that worked.)The pack will power two lights on low power for 15 hours.  It will power one light for over a day.  So in bright sun you could have one light always on.  Hang the lantern on a hook so it's near the charger (and so the included cord reaches the battery pack.)  This way you also have a fully charged lantern.  The lantern does not have a built-in solar panel (d.light makes a model with a built-in solar panel) so needs to be charged.  You can carry this to light your way, or hang it up for an additional light.I'm using this in a storage shed. I also occasionally take road trips and have slept in the bed of my truck or camped out. I'll take this on these trips - no need to kill the truck battery if I need light or have to charge my phone, etc."

        "text": "This an interesting idea especially if you have an outbuilding that has no electricity.  I decided on the shed I have down the garden, I was using an hanging lantern but not really that efficient or enough light.  Anyway easy to set this up, you basically put the solar panel where there is a lot of sun (in my case on the roof of the shed) then run the cord down and plug it into the control unit (the single socket on one side) and then plug in the 2 fixed lamps into any of the 4 sockets and wait for the sun to do it's work.This is where I have the problem, I am in WA so sun is not readily available this time of year but surprisingly after about a day I managed to get both lamps running and for the time I needed.  There is also a lantern included which you can also charge with the control unit.  The lantern is portable so great for walking back and forth when it is getting dark.I now pop in the shed whenever I want and I have all the light I need.  The 2 fixed lamps have switches so can be turned off and on and the lantern is the same.  One night I left everything on to see how good this was and next day the lights were still working.  You can also buy 2 extra fixed lamps because this has 4 sockets.  Also with this kit you don't necessarily need sun, you can just charge the control unit by putting a 12v 0.5A power adapter into the solar panel socket.The control unit also has a USB so you could use this for charging other devices like cell phones etc.  This would work really well if you were camping, you set everything up, have plenty of light and you can charge your devices.Build quality is decent, the solar panel and control unit are excellent.  The fixed lamps and lantern are plastic but sturdy enough.I like the idea of this kit and a new one for me, I  have never done anything solar before so a great experiment and a successful one too.  Great for outbuildings but I can certainly see a lot of campers going for this too."

I must admit that I was skeptical at first because almost everything that I buy that is solar powered has been flimsy and produced very dim light.  The d.light kit actually delivers all that is promises.  The light is bright for solar power.  It is more than enough to read by and lights a fairly good sized area.  Even though it is plastic, it isn't light weight and it doesn't feel or look cheap.  Setup wasn't too hard.  Everything is thoroughly explained and it was actually easy to figure out without constantly having to check the instructions.  I mounted mine in an outdoor garage/work area that I hate to go near at night.  My house is in an fairly isolated area that doesn't have street lamps, so this is perfect for me .  Before I got this system I had a low quality solar lamp that basically did nothing other than put out just enough light to keep me from crashing into anything.  The system is great.  I have found no flaws and the price is actually good when you consider how much lighting installation and power costs would be.  I would definitely recommend this system."

The cable to the control unit fit through a slight opening at the door's top so I didn't have to drill any holes.

They're good for what they do but ultimate you have a simple row of LEDs being fed some solar juice; it's not really a true solution akin to hardwiring real lights in your shed, garage, sun room etc.The (strangely named) d.light D20 however is about as close to running a physical line without needing the know how or dangers involved with such a project. There's a separate power source, switches, hanging lights and even a central station for controlling it independently as well as charging almost any USB devices.A little advanced planning in terms of solar panel placement is recommended, but it's not huge so can be screwed in anywhere. Then it's a simply case of finding nice spots for the switches and lights themselves. Everything is plug and go, no wire cutting needed and since it's all lower powered via DC you cannot get shocked even if you decide you need to splice in a few extra feet (although will invalidate the warranty).I placed this in my exterior double car garage, which is really a glorified shed. It's not in it's final location so I wanted something semi temporary that required no connection to the house electricity. Installation was super easy- mounted the solar panel, connected and hung the lamps, the main station and finally then ran the switches. Afterwards I stapled the wiring to make it neat and tidy and looped any extra wiring and tucked it away. Professional job in less time than it took to find the tools to do it.The next evening, after a good few hours of sun, I got to enjoy stepping into the shed without reaching for my flashlight. Of course, a five watt solar panel cannot in anyway compare to a fluorescent light running 120V in terms of brightness but you know, it's perfectly acceptable and the added bonus of a charging station and a lantern is the icing of this solar powerd cake.Requires little to no experience of doing such a project and the results speak for themselves. Great complete light/switch combo kit. Very impressed."

Also, being out in the desert the problem is that flowers just can't take the heat.July 18, 2014:  On Mother's Day in May my son and I bought a rose plant and potted it in a fancy pot for my wife.  Well, let me tell you, we put it out in the yard, pot and all.  The rabbits and other critters liked the plant a lot.  It had been blooming, but when these things got through with it all we had was a few stems and nothing else.  We brought the plant to a table in the back yard which was high enough so these varmits could not reach it.  Added some fresh soil and the shake and feed.  In about two weeks the leaves reappeared, and some blossoms came out.  Now this miniature plant is about 8 inches high, full of pink roses and is a joy to behold.  Water and Miracle Grow are the only items we have put on.  GO GET some if your roses need to be perked up!"

They tend to be a good bit more expensive but I'm not really wanting that around my free range chickens.  I've used the Miracle Grow Shake 'N Feed for a few years now with good results.For what it is worth, it compares almost as well as frequent, sparse natural chicken poop.  I've got knockout roses where my chickens hide under it and then the same roses of the same age in the same soil outside the fence that are never visited by the birds.I put this product around and under the roses that are OUTSIDE the fence.  The roses with this bloom just as beautifully and are lush and healthy, though just not quite as big as the ones that get the continual chicken tending.  This tells me that the nitrogen content is very much what a rose wants and needs to really turn on the blooms and produce the foliage.It's easy to apply- I love the new lid which keeps you from dumping the product out too fast.  The pellets come out and go over the cap and it helps distribute it.  Generally with my 5 large knockouts, 2 climbers, and an Old English Rose, I can get through the Southern (long) growing season with just one jug.If, however, you grow more finicky tea roses and/or have problems with aphids, Japanese beetles, or other bugs, and have no reason not to use it, you might prefer the food with the systemic insect and disease control in it.I grow sedum, snapdragons, coleus, fennel, and begonias around my roses and they get this and seem to like it as well.  It has never hurt any of my flowers.  My mini-roses are in the same beds and they like it every bit as much as the larger roses do- just watch that you don't over apply it - there's a picture on the jug showing how it should look on the ground if applied right - it's a great guide and easy to compare just with sight.  The main thing is - don't dump it or clump it- scatter it thinly.I also put mine out before I know it's going to rain.  By the end of the week, I'll have tons of blooms."

        "text": "I have found that a lot of people get confused by the different types of fertilizers and the hype that surrounds them so here is a quick guide.This Shake 'N Feed is a granular, slow-release fertilizer. Every time it rains or you water your plants. some of the fertilizer will dissolve in the water and feed the plants. The main advantage is that it feeds continuously and evenly over several months as long as they get water. Also keep in mind that too much water, from say a flooding rain will dilute the soil and you will need to reapply a little earlier.Liquid fertilizer, like regular Miracle-Gro has a more immediate effect. Since it is already in water, it is absorbed quickly to give the plants a burst of energy. Plants that bloom continuously like Hibiscus need this and fruit and vegetables that are setting fruit do too.Organic fertilizer comes in both versions above and also include compost which it very slow release, as it has to rot to be useful to the plants.The most important thing to remember is that this isn't a one or the other thing, you can use all of the above as required. Different plants have different needs at different times. Just as you might eat an orange every morning for vitamin C, but take a mega dose vitamin C pill when you feel a cold coming on, the same concept works in your garden. You should use compost to keep your soil healthy year round, use this Shake 'N Feed fertilizer when the plants fist bud in the spring, enter the heat of summer and start to go dormant in the fall and use liquid fertilizer to give them a boost when blooming, fruiting or when bugs or disease threatens them.Remember the best defense against garden pests and disease is having healthy plants."

Vine expects reviews to be done within thirty days, which has not been a sufficient amount of time for me to judge the efficacy of this product in promoting flowery growth.  So that part of the review will have to wait for later.I applied this product to two Spathiphyllum plants that are about ten years old.  The plants are generally robust, but were looking a bit tired.  I was impressed with how quickly they greened up to a nice dark green within just a few days of the application of this plant food.  They have not bloomed well in quite a while now, so it will be interesting to see if this product helps in that regard.I also like the dispenser very much.  It has been updated from the old style pouring spout style that all too easily dumped a pile of plant food instead of allowing it to be evenly dispersed.  The design of this dispenser causes the plant food to be distributed with the particles spaced away from each other, as the directions indicate should be done.  Very cool design.  I like it a lot.The one thing that I did not like about the container, however, was the lack of an NPK rating in big numbers on the front of the label.  The analysis is 9-18-9. The rating is what I always look for when shopping for plant food.  These numbers are only found in small numbers on the back label.  Due to the lack of prominent numbers on the front label, I would have probably passed right by this product if shopping for plant food in the garden department of a store. Hence the four stars instead of five.Looks to be a good product overall.Update, June, 2014:I can't say that this product did anything to help my Spathiphyllum plants to bloom.  To be fair, however, these are indoor plants, and variables such as air temperature and ambient light also impact their growth and bloom cycles.  BUT, I also put Shake 'N Feed on my potted outdoor geranium plants a few months ago, and they are absolutely going nuts with flowers.Therefore, I can recommend this product with confidence."

The combination provides an immediate boost, plus a long tail.Application - The package says that a single application lasts up to three months.  This 4-1/2 pound package will feed roughly 135 sq. ft. if you're using it in a flower bed.Composition - Nitrogen - 9%; Phosphate - 19%; Potash - 9%; Sulfur - 20%  Some (6%-12.5%-6%) of the Nitrogen, Phosphate and Potash has a polymer coating to allow for slow-release.  Note that this formulation, unlike it's all-purpose brethren, does not have any trace minerals.  It also has a substantially higher sulfur content, which helps to lower your soil pH.Usage - I live in California, in an area with a long growing season.  In Spring, I'll first apply Miracle-Gro All-Purpose plant food (also in the Shake'n Feed container).  That formula has a higher nitrogen content to help plants get growing.

This feeder achieves one out of three.It's not terribly hard to assemble, but the directions were less than helpful and I did have to fidget with it for a few minutes.  It's easy to use but holds only a small amount of seed and with the winter we've had this year, frequent refilling was not something I wanted to deal with (nor is it ever, really).  I'm still dreaming of the squirrel repellent, too.  Hanging it does ameliorate the cat problem, though.I think this might be a fun feeder for someone just starting to feed birds.  Platform feeders do attract a lot of species, and in all fairness, it's not the squirrels' favorite feeder.  It would also dispense safflower seed very well, which squirrels don't like (although it's really not #1 on the hit parade for most birds, either).  If I were gifting this to a new bird-feeding fan, I'd include a bag of safflower for this feeder, a bag of black sunflower, and aBrome Squirrel Buster Plusfor the black sunflower."

The grate covers the seed, so that if any squirrel can get past the baffle, they can't get at the seed.I placed this bird feeder at the end of a long metal hook that hangs from a tree branch (like I do all my bird feeders). Unfortunately for us, the only creatures that came near this bird feeder were the squirrels. Even on a day with only a very slight breeze, the baffle constantly moved and this seemed to scare away the birds. By day 2, the squirrels had gotten past the baffle and were munching on the bird seed. Not only that, but they somehow managed to knock this feeder off the hook and it was on the ground (the only feeder I've ever had that has been knocked to the ground).Considering how easily the squirrels got to this feeder and how little seed fits in the tray (as it can only hold about 1/2 pound of bird seed), this feeder didn't work for us."

Either the wind is blowing hard enough to make it swing and unhook itself, or a deer or squirrel is trying to get at the seed and swinging it so that it unhooks and falls.  I have not seen how it's happening yet, but do far it's just dumping seed on the ground.  The birds were using it for the brief time it was hanging though.  I'm thinking maybe a platform feeder like this needs to be hung from a rope/string at least 7-8 feet off the ground, and at least 8 feet from any objects a squirrel could jump from and dump out the seed."

We hung ours in an alcove under the eves of our house which can been view through a window but is very protected from the prevailing winds. We have had no problems with the hood flopping about or becoming displaced.Now this thing IS NOT squirrel proof but is squirrel resistant. If you hang this thing near a handy branch of a tree, near a post or anything else a squirrel can climb, then they will simply do a lateral jump and have free access until the seeds run dry. Hanging our where we have we have had no problems and the hood efficiently dumps the greedy little critters on the ground which is sort of funny to watch.This unit does not hold all that much food which should be considered before purchase. It is fine in our case as we use it with over 25 other feeding stations about the place. The grate is effective but should be cleaned once a week just like any other feeder even if you don't have moldy food in it. Clean feeders help keep strong birds around.It too several days for the birds to get use to this thing but once they did they use it as freely as any other feeder we have.All in all we are quite happy with this thing.

Each and every one is constantly raided by our plethora of squirrels.  The plastic of the feeders is chewed apart by the squirrels, most of the seed goes to them, and the rest they find ways to jump on the feeders to spill the seeds on the ground where they all can gather with ease.The design of the Perky-Pet includes an Umbrella type cover that attaches loosely to the hanger.  It is meant to be loose so that if a squirrel or other mean, old seed predator tries to jump on top, it simply tips to the side and they fall off.  It does do that...the squirrels have failed in every attempt to gain access.  However, in any breeze, that same umbrella top flips around, up and down, from side to side, and scares the birds off!As a result, after 2 weeks of hanging in a tree, nary a seed is gone.  Guess it will help save costs of seed, but I am hoping the birds adjust to it soon.UPDATED POST:I am going to have to locate a spot completely out of the wind for this feeder.  Calm, almost windless day today and the birds are all over it.  Meanwhile, the squirrels keep trying and it is fun watching them become dive-bombers to the ground.  I have secluded spots to place it, but the only trouble is it's out of sight from any window, and is not where we can enjoy seeing the birds feeding.FINAL UPDATE:This feeder is never going to be worthwhile.  It needed to be removed from any area that had wind, even light breezes, and we did that.  Unfortunately, birds like to feed where there is cover and the only place this could be mounted was in a small niche in the house side.  No birds came to feed.  Taking it down tomorrow and putting it away in the basement."

The metal rod can be adjusted for your preferred height before hanging up the feeder.I put this up in March, and the day after, there was snow, mixed precipitation and wind.  Whenever I looked out, it was bobbling around but stayed up fine, although some snow got into the metal grill or was absorbed through it when it began to warm up.  However, since it's almost spring, I doubt this will be a problem for the months to come.So far the squirrels have not discovered the feeder, or if they have, they haven't managed to stay on the platform long enough to spill the seed onto the ground, which is what they've done with previous feeders I've put up.  My yard has the usual birds that don't seem to migrate in winter around here: cardinals, robins, titmice and chickadees.  So far, they have had no problems visiting the feeder.

In fact, the only birds who even bother with this feeder in my backyard are those nuisance starlings and grackles.Depending on what I filled it with during my 6 week testing period - seed, suet, peanut nuggets or mealworms - the platform feeder did attract a few species of wild birds at first.  As a full-time resident of the Gulf coast of west central Florida where the birdlife is unusually rich and abundant, I have identified many species at my other bird feeders but only the starlings and grackles continued to visit this platform feeder, especially when I filled it with peanut nuggets or mealworms. (The squirrels, by the way, do not like the mealworms).I positioned my feeder in a nearby tree using a 36-inch \"S\" branch-hook which provides a lot of clearance around the feeder to foil the squirrels. The adjustable dome is designed to wobble and throw the squirrels off balance when they attempt a raid but my squirrels still manage to get under it, tilt the feeder and spill the food. I don't mind this too much though because I also enjoy watching the birds ground feed.The Perky-Pet platform feeder is made in China and requires some assembly. It is easy to assemble but the wire grate that fits overs the metal feeding dish is warped on my unit and is a very poor fit, leaving about a half inch gap allowing the squirrels a better foothold and easier access to the food. I have since removed this grate inasmuch as it serves no good purpose.The distance between the dome and the feeding dish is adjustable but the dome is also a poor fit and sits at an angle, wobbling and bouncing wildly on its spring with the slightest movement of air. It is not a bad looking feeder but I would visually like it better if all of its pieces were a straighter fit and the feeder didn't look so wonky.The feeder requires frequent cleaning which means dismantling the feeder. It's a bit of a hassle to disassemble the feeder twice a week but necessary to prevent disease transmission in birds through decayed and contaminated food.But during the process of frequent disassembling, cleaning and reassembling, I've done a little experimenting with this feeder trying to make it a more successful feeder for wild birds and this is what I've discovered:1. The grate really is useless so I just keep it off.2. The bouncing dome does not deter squirrels. Rather it scares the birds away. So I tried keeping the dome off in order to attract more birds. This didn't really work for attracting desirable birds other than nuisance birds. I also discovered that the dome is actually beneficial for keeping the feed protected from the elements and bird droppings. So I decided to continue using it.3. The dome does work better when I reassemble the feeder without using the spring. The dome wobbles much less and is more steady without the spring and therefore doesn't frighten the birds with that frantic wobbling.After all this tweaking I'm still not satisfied with this Perky Pet feeder. I most definitely would not buy another. Nor would I ever recommend it. In fact, mine has gone in the trash.If you really want a squirrel proof wild bird feeder I highly recommend theBrome 1015 Squirrel Buster Classic. Bromes are expensive but they are worth every penny. My Brome feeders paid for themselves in no time, just by what they save me in all the birdfeed that the squirrels cannot access."

        "text": "I'm sorry, I'm a nice guy and I don't like to trash anyone products or ideas, but this feeder, while cute and fairly well made, has a lot of issue that prevent it from being a truly useful feeder. But read on because I also found a good use for it.First, let me tell you how to prevent squirrels in your feeders 100-percent of the time. I've been feeding birds for decades (I'm not going to say how many decades, lol) and while I have tons of gray squirrels on my property, none of them get to my feeders unless I want them to get there (and I do allow them to get to one of my tray feeders, particularly in cold winters). Squirrels can only jump approximately four vertical feet and a little more than that horizontally. So, if you go to a bird-feeder/wildlife supplies store, or your local home store, and buy a say, 8' of metal piping and plant it in the ground (bird feeder stores, if you have one nearby, have a cool tool for this that makes the job ultra easy), you can place a baffle on the pipe just over four feet off the ground and the squirrels will *not* get past it. Then you can put a double or triple shepherd's hook at the top and hang several feeders. I have a 2' x 2' open tray feeder on another pole filled to the brim and no squirrel has ever feasted there. So what you need is a pole, a baffle and some kind of hooks at the top for hanging feeders: all of this is available in a bird-feeding store (I won't mention the chain name here because Amazon will take it out--but it has \"wild\" in the name). (Squirrels *can* jump downward amazing heights, by the way, so you must be careful not to be under a tree limb--I've seen squirrels drop 20 feet vertically.)As far as this feeder goes. First of all, the dome is great for keeping the birds and seed a bit dryer, but it's not going to deter any squirrels. Five mins after the first squirrel got onto this feeder (and I hung it under a tree limb so that he could get there), he hung by his back paws from the loop and swung himself down. Mission accomplished.Also, the description says this hold 3.5 lbs of seed--hah, in someone's dreams. This hardly holds anything. A half pound if you're lucky. The feeder tray is only 9.5-inches across and less than an inch deep.OK, all of that said, there are uses for this feeder and, as I said, it's a cute feeder, pretty nicely made. As at least one other reviewer stated this make a good thistle (niger) feeder--excellent, in fact (some seed does drip out the drain holes, but that can't be avoided). But small finches do have trouble getting their beaks through the grating, so I removed it. I just fill the tray with thistle and they sit on the edge and it works just fine.In it's own way, I kind of find the feeder useful, now the goldfinches have their own little feeder and since squirrels don't like that type of seed, the barely pay it any mind. This feeder is not what it says it is, it's not a squirrel warrior, but it's kind of pretty and I'm sure you can find uses for it. Ironically, if you took off the dome and got rid of the grid, you could fill it with peanuts and feed the squirrels. Or, if you have fruit-eating birds like Baltimore Orioles, you can place orange sections in it. Nothing beats seeing an Oriole at the feeder! If you want to buy the best bird feeders around, look at Droll Yankee. I've probably spent a thousand dollars on feeders over the years and theirs last forever."

Normally, the large birds hog all the food for the little birds even though we put out feeders for all sizes.  Some birds are just pigs and don't share well.  Depending on the wind though, the movement of the top does scare the smaller guys but they jump back in once they realize it is still safe.  I can't report on whether squirrels are deterred from the feeder as we do not have many squirrels in our location.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the instructions/grate.  The instructions show to put the grate in the opposite way than we did.  When we followed the instructions and put the grate in so that the supporting bars underneath are on the bottom as they should be, the grate sits crooked.  It is a lot crooked as in 1/2 inch above the bottom on one side and down inside the food container on the other which is not a good thing.

Hairy houdinis can crack the code on just about everything.  Instead, I've learned to hang feeders beyond squirrel reach or use above and below baffling.  Unless one does that, the little baffle and wire grate on this feeder are ineffective.Why do I like it then?  This metal feeder is sturdy, of simple design, holds very little seed, and birds flock to it.  They seem to prefer open platform feeders, and this one has a nice low lip.  I have other expensive cedar platform feeders, but their sides measure 2\".  That may not seem like much, but birds do not like feeling confined, and they're always on the lookout for a quick escape if predators approach.  Consequently, this platform is much more popular than the cedar ones.Having clean and fresh seed in platform feeders is important, so its smaller 1/2 lb seed capacity is ideal.  The wire grate is removable.  I've elected to keep it off permanently which makes for very easy cleaning or tossing of sunflower hulls.  There are small drainage holes in the bottom, but I drilled in a few more, and it was a very easy process.This small feeder sits outside our kitchen window, and has endless bird traffic from dawn until dusk.

I also keep the grate off, because little birds have trouble getting any seed unless the feeder is completely full. So it is sort of a mini platform feeder.

The baffle and the mechanism that holds it in place are all plastic. I had several problems with the baffle:* The baffle sits on top of a spring, which makes it wobble continuously, even in a light breeze (rather than being weight activated like most anti-squirrel baffles). The wobbling made birds visibly nervous, even though it was placed at several times the height of the tufted titmouses that were the first visitors.* In windy conditions, that wobbling gets worse (you can hear it bonking around from inside). The wobbling makes the baffle work its way downwards. After one 24-hour spell of typically windy mid-Atlantic Spring weather, the baffle had worked its way all the way down to the base of the feeder. The plastic mechanism that holds it in place had been tightened fully just two days before. I tested it afterwards (it was still tight) but I found steady pressure would make the baffle move-- which is what the wind-storm had done.* The baffle doesn't keep squirrels off, at least not when hanging from a post. The squirrel just climbs up the post, and then side-steps or leaps onto the feeder (bypassing the baffle).  My squirrels figured this out the very first day the feeder was out.So, the baffle is now permanently off, and I'll only use the feeder when I don't mind squirrels eating from it also (the grate doesn't prevent their access in any way). Also, this feeder is on the small side-- it takes less black oiler sunflower than I'd use in a short tube feeder.Other thoughts: Without the baffle, it's easy to dump out any leftover seed or other cruft stuck under the grate (with the baffle, it's awkward to do so). With no real squirrel-proofing and considering the limited capacity, the feeder could be cheaper. The included directions are fairly useless-- I wish companies would take a lesson from IKEA with its clear, simple diagrams. Fortunately the assembly is much easier than the directions make it out to be.With its sturdy metal construction (and no baffle), this feeder works reasonably well, but it's not anything special. If you just need a simple hanging feeder, there are a lot of other designs out there."

Also I have found that during rainy weather some of the finches outside will actually hang out and eat under the dome, with acting as an umbrella.

        "text": "*NOTE*--I still love this feeder and it's still the #1 feeder that our finches go to but I needed to tweak things about it to have it function well. The first problem addressed was that on windy days, the constant bobbling of the dome caused the seed pan to shake itself free from the nut on the stainless pole, causing the entire pan to fall down! Now, if you've ever tried to find a 1/4\" silver nut in the snow, you know the problem! I had to buy a package of them at the hardware store since no one sells just \"one\". Nothing we did to tighten the new nuts worked, so ultimately, to avoid the pan from constantly coming undone, we Crazy Glued the nut in place and that's worked beautifully! Since every other feeder we own has a rigid \"in place\" feeder platform that can't be removed, I had no qualms with making our feeder tray permanently attached to the pole. 2) The second problem we encountered was with that metal screen. I'm not really sure what the purpose of it was but we noticed that it acted as a deterrent to the birds trying to get seeds out of the pan. Peanuts are NOT \"one size fits all\" so the larger nuts would stay stuck in the pan, with NO ability for the birds to wrangle them out. So, before we glued the nut to the steel hook, we removed the metal tray and now EVERYONE'S HAPPY!This feeder is the star of our garden and before any other feeder fills with birds, this one is always at maximum capacity. It even held up to 30 mile per hour winds during our latest \"Spring\" snow storms. We're delighted that we got this feeder for our fine-feathered friends. :DAnd now, the bottom is from my original review:My husband and I live in very rural Michigan, right along Lake Michigan's flight path for birds. We have an exceedingly healthy and abundant Winter population of \"The Usual Suspect's\": Cardinals, Goldfinches, House Finches, many Sparrow species, Doves, Bluejays, Titmouse, various Woodpeckers and Junco's. On our acre of land, we have 13 feeding stations set up, both for our enjoyment from many different windows but also to prevent fighting. (and as a parent, we ALL know that \"kids fight!\")I own many Perky-Pet feeders and they are beautifully made and crafted. We do NOT have a squirrel problem out here, simply because there's so much wild land for them to feed and frolic. This new feeder is a much needed and much welcomed addition to our garden, catering exclusively to whatever size bird you choose to gift with the contents of the feeder.Set up was a breeze! Oh, how I love companies that really, truly KNOW how to write instructions! With the clear plastic dome, the entire feeder is a Thing of Beauty, and I was a bit sad, putting it into the elements where I know within 24 hours, it will be on it's way to productive shabbiness. But, such is life. LOLWe LOVE the adjustable height of the dome! We really, really LOVE that drainage holes have been place on the feeder tray so the seeds don't end up swimming in rain water...NICE TOUCH, Perky Pets! We even loved the Q.R. code on the packaging, which led us to Perky Pets Youtube site, so we could revel in their other feeders and see not only the designs we do and do not own but how the feeders should look when actively used.Perhaps it's because of the sheer volume of birds that come to our feeders, but we had zero problems attracting featured birds to this feeder. The first, of course, was our bold friend, the Blue Jay! Thoroughly happy with being the ONLY bird at this new feeder, he didn't even care to announce to his cronies that \"Hey, Jays! There's a new feeder here...with PEANUTS!!!!\" He happily gorged himself on 28 peanuts (yes, we counted!), and then finally flew away. Minutes later, a Titmouse showed up, and apparently having better manners than Mr. Jay, he announced to his relatives that \"Peanuts! Peanuts!\" were being now served at our Country Cottage, and the feeder was filled within minutes with 8 Titmouse. :D Over the course of a day, everyone came and enjoyed themselves, but none more than my husband and I.The peanuts we buy are very dear in price: a dollar a pound. So, we put them out very sparingly, simply because we don't want to take on another job to simply buy those peanuts! With this feeder, NOTHING goes to waste and I notice they don't even scatter upon the ground. This is an attractive, jolly and very economical way for us to feed our feathered friends the most expensive of feeds and enjoy their antics as our payment.I love when a company makes such a stand out product that TRULY functions, as advertised!"

My experience is that this feeder is very easy to assemble (although there are plenty of feeders you can buy that don't require assembly), easy to hang, and moderately effective at keeping squirrels away. The &#34;dome&#34; (12 inch diameter) is set on a spring so it wobbles in the wind and it's been very windy here lately so the birds and squirrels have been kept away by the crazy wobbling more than I would guess is usual. The bottom plate (9 3/4&#34; diameter, 2/3&#34; depth) doesn't hold much seed, so it has to be refilled often. The feeder itself has a light, elegant style that looks great in the garden. Maximum distance from bottom plate to edge of &#34;dome&#34; is just under 8 inches, so most wild birds can be accommodated. Generally a very nice, simple feeder that incorporates some good ideas. But definitely not perfect."

        "text": "Update, April 2014:  My original three-star review is posted below. I am updating to remove one star. A few weeks after posting my review, I looked out the window to behold a huge squirrel comfortably perched on the grate of the feeder, chowing down on bird seed. When I went out to chase him off, he had a couple of moments of trouble escaping due to the dome, but then made a huge leap onto a faraway branch and scampered away. Squirrels are amazing acrobats, especially when there's good food to be had. This feeder will not deter them.Original Review:Some clever ideas have gone into the designing of this bird feeder, but in actual use the results aren't as good as I'd hoped. Being able to raise and lower the dome according to the size of birds you want to attract seems like a great option. However, when I set the dome down low to accommodate small birds, the juncos and chickadees and song sparrows had a hard time figuring out how to get to the feeding platform without hitting the dome. Then, while they were feeding, they seemed nervous about the way the dome wobbles on its spring, like they thought it was going to hit them.I set the dome up higher and now the small birds like the feeder. The grate that sits over the seed to keep out squirrels is a good idea, and the little birds are comfortable hopping around on the grate to get their food. I've noticed the ground-feeding birds like juncos especially like the dome because it makes them feel safe when they're under it.The problem I see with the feeder now is that the little birds with small beaks can only get food from under the grate when the feeding tray is completely full. Once the level of seed drops, the little birds have a hard time digging seed out from the spaces in the grate. I have watched chickadees hop around to various places on the grate trying to get a seed out, then finally get frustrated and fly to one of the other feeders in my yard where they don't have to work so hard.The feeder is easy to fill. I can just pour the seed in through the spaces in the grate. However, the feeder only holds half a pound of seed, so keeping the seed level high enough for short beaks to reach it requires some vigilance. So far I haven't seen any squirrels try to outsmart the design of this feeder, so I can't comment on that yet."

The only time I would use the grate that came with this one is if I sliced up a suet cake and placed that in the feeder, instead of seed.  That's the good thing about platform feeders--you can put anything in them. You could put seed in this one or nuts or fruit or bread or peanut butter or anything you wanted.  The squirrel baffle might protect seed from the rain some, but certainly not on a windy day. My squirrels are way too smart to be defeated by this feeder. The top hook can easily be knocked loose from a branch.  But, as I said, I really do like platform feeders, and this one will be easier to keep clean than a wooden one."

        "text": "The Perky-Pet Adjustable Platform Wild Bird Feeder is made by one of the most reliable feeder brands on the market.This model comes with a wire grate on the feeding tray that discourages non-bird predators.  The dome also makes overhead access more difficult, but neither is going to deter a determined - and hungry - squirrel.However, the adjustable dome does allow the owner to select what size birds he feeds.  Ours is set for finches and other small birds, and, after having the process demonstrated by a brave titmouse, the feeder was quickly popular with smaller avians.The smaller opening between tray and dome that we selected does make filling the tray more difficult.  The Wild Birds feeder that this is replacing was much easier to adjust for filling, but it lacked the grate.In summary, this feeder is simple to assemble and will be easy to clean.  It's also easy to adjust for smaller birds.  But the dome isn't as easily adjustable as it could be.  Further, it may slow down the squirrel onslought, but it's unlikely to stop them."

With the squirrel cover on top that is adjustable it keeps the little buggers from wiping our my seed while letting in the smaller birds.  It also helps protect the seed from the elements so that it's not full of water or snow.  There is nothing worse that cleaning out a flat feeder after it snows and is starting to freeze up.  Bottom is made of metal and top is plastic.  Word to the wise though is don't put this near a fence or tree as the squirrels will still get past the sheild if you do.

Cleaning can be as simple as squirting the tray out with a hose every two or three weeks and letting it dry before adding fresh seed.  The squirrel baffle balances on a small spring and tips to dump squirrels, but a determined squirrel did manage to get on the tray and get some seed through the metal mesh.  This is a good feeder but I prefer, and recommend,  the type that holds the bird feed in a container that protects it from the elements."

Mounting it should be pretty easy, there are two ways to do it or you can just hang it from the wire at the top.I'm not impressed with the plastic covering for the seed bin, however. This will grow cloudy over time and - if there is bright sunlight - will break down over the course of a summer. I've had many similar plastic items do the same from sun exposure. For the price, it's not horrible, you should get maybe 2 years out of this feeder before the plastic begins to deteriorate. Once that happens, unless you are a glass blower, you probably will need to replace this unit.I put this one out and within a few short days the birds were visiting and eating happily. I'm not happy with the limited perching space, in my backyard this leads to many squabbles. I have another, much larger feeder where many birds can eat without fighting. I had not thought about this aspect before, but now realize that a smaller feeder means you might want to have several feeder in the yard from which your feathered friends can choose.3 stars for a short-term feeder."

It is only a matter of days before that hole will be twice its original size. Plexi glass would have been a much better choice. The 2nd squirrel issue is that the top doesn't latch; savvy squirrels have had no trouble flipping open the top - plus the wind has also caused to top to pop open.I do like the flat back and ability to mount to a wall or post. I used two nails, one for the handle and one for the slot on the back, to ensure it would hang securely. My perspective is that for a person without squirrel problems and who wants a small feeder to attach to a wall or post, this will most likely do the job and is why I gave it 2* instead of 1*.

The front is thick clear plasticwhich has all edges finished and strengthened with metal.The clear front makes it nice to view the level, and is bite resistant to squirrels.This is perfect to hang on our privacy fence among the bittersweet vine which is a favorite area of birds.The feeder is a bit smaller then I expected, 9 1/2\" tall x 4 1/4\" wide, (roof 6 1/4\") and of courseit's flat on it's back side for hanging on a post or wall, still it holds a decent amount of food (3 cups)and has an attractive appearance.The instructions with the feeder says the top slides up the hanger to open for filling, which isn't correct.The hanger is only a hanger  It can be removed / or used to hang the feeder / or flipped down out of the way.because there's also a hole on the back side of the feeder for hangingBetween the two options I chose to use the stainless steel hanger for a couple of reasons.> 1. When the hole is used, the feeder is flat against the fence which won't allow the hinged top to open.> 2. Because of same issue ^ the feeder needs completely filled before hanging back up,but then the food covers the view of the hole making it difficult to find.The feeder is good quality ~ well constructed ~ an attractive.Update March 15, 2014 - The birds found the feeder later same day as hanging (10 days ago) & been using it since.It appears with the feeder in the middle of the privacy fence birds feel safer because our outdoorcats can't stalk them there, and so far squirrels haven't bothered feeder either."

It is rather small, but since it's near the house, it's easy to add more seed regularly.I am a little disappointed in the construction. The metal is thin. While the lid closes, it would be easy for a squirrel to pick up and eat the seed from the top. So far, the squirrels haven't done this. The post is not easy to climb, and it's not under a tree where they could drop down on the cover.There is a metal band around the plastic seed holder at the top, presumably to keep squirrels from biting the seed container. However, the seed tray is plastic and could easily be chewed on by squirrels.I'm not dissatisfied with this bird feeder. It has some good points, but it could be much better."

Of course you can observe the birds feeding closely if you do the latter mount.It's easy to refill, (in winter it will empty pretty fast and you'll need to refill it at least daily if you have lots of birds coming in), and equally easy to take down.Of course no feeder is squirrel-proof and we just accept that, so be prepared for that caveat.I thought the quality could have been slightly better but for the price it's not bad.Highly recommended."

        "text": "My husband and I are blessed: we not only have a wee country cottage that we call our home but also a tiny studio condo in the City, to cut down on commuting 180 miles,  round trip for business and pleasure purposes. And one of the things we've learned is that almost EVERYTHING needs to be \"scaled down\" in size, for Urban Use, whether it's a patio set that only seats 2 people vs. 8 people; a small grill that can handle a couple of burgers vs. a side of beef, and even bird feeders...yes, even bird feeders.Out in the country, we have 14 feeders, ranging from multiples of suet feeders, feeding platform feeders, tube feeders and thistle feeders. Nary a pigeon, rat nor squirrel in sight, we don't have the problems of feeding birds that plagues Urban gardens.That's why, when I received this feeder, I instantly thought: BALCONY!!!, and that's indeed where it has ended up. Anyone who's ever lived in the city with a balcony knows ALL the problems: too small of a space, too shallow, usually metal railings that support nothing and slats of boards for floors so the 3rd floor is always messing up the 2nd and 1st floor balconies.THIS feeder is just PERFECT for small urban spaces, either vertical (condo) or horizontal (home) which still have no trees in their own garden, due to lack of space. Yes, it can be hung by it's sturdy and handy swivel latch, but it also has a very, very nice key-hole cut out on the back, making it perfect to hang from a simple nail against a wood balcony wall. And since it's so simple to open up the patio door and refill this feeder, it's small size is perfect for filling every other day.We've had NO problems with this feeder. Our metal top, unlike so many other's, fits tightly and snugly...there simply is NO gap between the top and clear walls. For the type of birds we're attracting: Mourning Doves/Chickadees/Finches/and Sparrows, the ample metal perch and strong seed catcher holds every bird that lands. We're lucky, in that a crab apple tree is directly outside of our condo window, so the birds have perched on our porch, forever. We've also had small metal trays of food on our tiny patio table, so they were used to coming to our home for food.We love this feeder. It's definitely a \"niche\" category; I wouldn't use it in a suburban or rural area, simply because there's too many birds that visit those yards and the shape and limited capacity would/could make this problematic. Much larger feeding tubes and platform feeders are the ones that work out there.But, for people who live in tiny spaces that LOVE birds and want to attract them, THIS is a wonderfully thought out feeder. If you have a relative or friend in assisted living, this feeder would be a welcome gift to have outside of their window to enjoy.Bottom line: Our feathered friends HIGHLY recommend it! And we enjoy being able to have our morning tea at the window, enjoying Nature, up close. :D"

We love to watch all the birds come back for the spring and summer and anything we can put out to entice them is all for the better.What I liked about this Waterer:1. It is large enough (64 oz.) so I don't have to fill it constantly but small enough not to be overly heavy.2. It is easy to fill.3. It is plastic but on the sturdy side.4. It is pretty nondescript, so I doesn't present any decorating challenges. (Hey, when we can finally use the deck I like it to look nice out there alright?!)5. When you fill it the water comes slowly out of the base giving you time to get it in place before dealing with a disc of open sloshing water.Drawbacks:1. I am really not sure that this would stay full any length of time if I tried to hang it in a tree, we have enough winds around here that I think most of the water would be on the ground in pretty short order.2. From other comments, I think I lucked out and got a good waterer, looks like there are some quality concerns, so be aware, I can only review the item I received but consumers should be aware of potential quality issues.Recommended with above reservations."

The top part has a hook already attached, and there is a bottom tray type part which allows the birds (and likely other small wild critters) to perch.  According to the instructions, the holes allow rain to come through and collect, after being filtered and holds up to 64 ounces of water.So far, it has stayed on the tree outside my window without a problem.  The Perky Pet Feeder I had tended to bobble around a lot in a strong wind, but since I will be using this during the summer, that probably won't be an issue.  Since the standing bird baths I have had tend to collect dirt and need to be tipped regularly to prevent mosquitos from breeding, the hanging feeder should be a good alternative.

It stands about 10&#8221; high and is 8&#8221; in diameter. The top is plastic mesh, allowing the reservoir to be filled from the top, or to be refilled by rainwater. The waterer includes a metal hanger on the top lid to the reservoir. The design allows water to trickle continuously from the reservoir to keep the lower tray full at all times. The lower tray has toe holds on the edges for birds to perch on.I hung my waterer in my back yard, which is generally filled with wild songbirds. In addition to feeders, I also keep a self-standing birdbath in the yard. The waterer hung for a week in a bush near both the feeders and the birdbath, but no birds made use of it during that time. Then I had to move my feeders indoors because wild bears were seen in the neighborhood stealing from bird feeders. I figured this waterer would be safe to leave out despite the bears because it did not contain any food, and did not smell like food. But I was wrong. Bears are smart&#8212;the next night they went straight for this waterer because it looks like a feeder and hangs like one. A bear cub walked right up to the waterer, took a sip from the edge, then tore the waterer apart. I also had problems with leakage with this waterer&#8212;if the waterer doesn't stay completely level, then water drips over the edge of the bottom tray, and the reservoir slowly empties onto the ground (it can completely empty in as little as 15 minutes). Even if you manage to hang it so that it is exactly level, a gusty breeze can tip it; I found half the water gone after a windy night. What I can I say? Perhaps this waterer might work in urban environments where there are no bears and birds are really thirsty and you don't have much wind. But if you live in an area where bears are a problem, a self-standing birdbath might be a safer bet since bears don't expect to find food in them."

Great idea!The problem is that this thing simply doesn't hold water--even when it's perfectly level. I tested it in my kitchen sink and filled it with water and left it on bottom of the sink and came back a while later (like a half hour) and it was completely empty. So I tried it again, and I put it in a bucket with a perfectly level bottom to make sure I was giving it a fair test and (insert buzzer noise here), another fail!I've been trying to think of someway to re-engineer this so I can find a use for it, but so far nothing.Who in their right mind would sell a product that didn't work at all? If you want to give the birds a drink (great idea!) do yourself a favor: buy a nice birdbath or a little garden fountain (birds like running water, so the latter is probably a better idea).As far as this goes: Next!"

I've hung it in a tree so it's handy for perching birds, but out of reach of marauding felines who are too fat to climb.

It's a little tricky to assemble, but operates on the same principle as the dog and cat waterer that invert a reservoir over a bowl and the water level is controlled by physics and a spring.  The unit is pretty heavy when full, and the hanging loop isn't all that sturdy, so I hope it can stand up to the outdoors and the water's weight.This is a wonderful offering to our backyard birds, who seem to like us in spite of the Meowing Menaces.

However, I have now experienced more of the problems that some of the other reviewers encountered, and this waterer is pretty much useless to me.  When I filled the empty container this morning, I apparently did not have it centered right on the hook, and water spilled out continuously.  I tried twice to recenter it, but could not get it laser-level even, and it spilled until it was completely empty.  No wind today.  Don't the designers actually test these things??~~~~~~~I like the idea of this bird waterer.  The birds have not used it yet, but I think they probably will as weather gets hotter and water gets scarcer.  Previous to getting this, I used a hummingbird feeder as a waterer, but that, of course, limits the kinds of birds that can use it.  (The feeder leaked, and I didn't want sugar water on the ground attracting ants, but a little water leaking was okay.)So, this product should have been ideal.  And it would have been had it been better designed and made.The reservoir is quite large, and when I am filling it and holding it by the saucer underneath, the saucer is so flimsy that I'm afraid it is going to break.I couldn't carry it outside without spilling on the floor between the kitchen and back door.  The saucer is too shallow.  I know that birds like shallow water, but the sides still could have been made higher.  There is no lip or anything that helps keep the water from sloshing out.The waterer is hung on my patio, sheltered from most sun and most wind, but still gets a little of both.  The slightest breeze causes it to spill, emptying it in short order.  The saucer is so shallow that I can't even climb onto the chair I use to reach the hook without spilling water, usually down the front of whatever I am wearing.The top is perforated, supposedly to let in rainwater as well as making filling easy.  What it does more often, in this land of little rain, is let in tiny bugs.The reservoir is frosted plastic, but I can't find information on what kind of plastic it is.  I would prefer glass or plastic that is safe for water bottles.  I don't know if this plastic is harmful to birds.It is easy to clean, and the reservoir does hold quite a bit of water.  A smaller reservoir that didn't spill so easily would be a better idea.  I looked at some of the other waterers available, and several have different reservoirs but the same too-shallow saucer underneath.Given the negatives, this feeder with a patio light shining behind it in the evenings makes a very pretty glow.  The birds don't seem to care, though."

        "text": "The idea of a hanging bird-waterer is a good one, providing water for birds that shy away from the ground, in an elevated location where they are safe from predation. It's both easy to top-off and self-filling (with rain water) through the perforated top. A flow limiter keeps the reservoir from just pouring out the bottom.So what's to not like? Unfortunately, a lot. For one, the bottom is too shallow to hold much water. Combined with the swaying motion of the waterer in the wind (or its wobble when first hung), water dribbles/drips over the edge steadily, leaving an empty unit after a day or two. It's possible the flow limiter isn't working right either, and allowing the pressure of the reservoir's contents to overfill the tray.The platforms edge also seems too shallow/rounded for birds to grip and land-- the design looks like it might have been modeled after a hummingbird feeder (they don't generally land when they feed).Worst of all, I didn't observe any birds using the unit. Maybe they were just nervous about the new unit-- but they didn't shy away from the feeder on the same post, and did patronize the nearbydeck-mount birdbath(since discontinued, but my favorite). Maybe \"puddle in a tree\" isn't natural for my birds? I even tried the waterer at my mother's house (she's an expert birder), with a different population of birds. No luck there either-- and she tried moving it to different locations and hanging arrangements in a futile effort to get birds to drink from this unit.Finally, the top doesn't close tight unless you try (hold the top and lift/turn the bottom)-- otherwise it's just a slight turn, and it doesn't lock into place at all. I wouldn't be surprised if the waterer twisting in the wind works its way loose and comes apart periodically.I was able to easily fill the unit with a watering can, though a piece or two of leaf had already worked its way into the reservoir the first week of use. It would likely need to be cleaned out periodically. The bottom tray also gathered small leaves in the same week (non-autumn).A good idea, but this implementation is badly flawed."

But no, even if you put this on a flat level surface, the tray below will fill and then start running over and pretty soon the whole thing is empty.

The streak has been broken with this.A waterer is a great idea, especially here in the dry west.  I was excited to have a chance to test this unit, but I began to get the &#34;uh-oh&#34; feeling almost immediately.  It has a snap-together construction--nothing particularly bad about the idea--but I found that it was very easy to snap the bowl/perch area right off the feeder.  The weight of a jay (a common bird here) would have been enough to snap it right off: that is if water had stayed in it long enough to attract that jay.This unit is extremely sensitive to orientation.  Any tilt--no matter how slight--will be sufficient to drain it dry.  This might be fine on a windless, airless planet.  But here on earth, the smallest breeze was enough to knock it out of the vertical.  I could see the water dribbling out, and it only took about 15 minutes for the thing to be completely empty.  There were no evident flaws in construction.  This is a problem of design.It's top-fillable without disassembly.  The idea is to catch rainwater--a noble idea.  But try filling it from a jug.  It only accepts a slow flow of water and you have to stand there dribbling in the water for several minutes.  I think it drains faster than it fills.  Perky-Pet needs to head back to the drawing board (or directly to the bin) with this unit.  It's a great idea, but this implementation fails completely."

I'm not too keen on how the saucer connects to the bottom part of the container. If you don't put it together just right, the saucer will fall off when the weight of the water hits it. Other reviewers have stated that the waterer is empty over night. I have a feeling that's due to the issue I just mentioned; it's difficult to get it attached properly and I think the water just drains out. When I DO get it right, it works fine. Also due to its lightweight material, it will sway and empty more quickly on windy days.I like the capacity. I've seen up to four birds (finches, wrens, black capped chickadees...smaller birds) sit and drink from it. I've not seen anyone try to bathe in it yet:) ~ bought this specifically for my front yard. I have a feeder or two that I want to keep the birds at. However they tend to go to our back feeders, where our birdbath is located. I thought this would do the trick to keep some birds in front and some birds in back. It suits my purpose. All in all, it's okay, but I think they construction could have used a bit more thought/common sense, and I don't believe it would have increased the cost by much, if at all.

The two chairs were stacked, and were very well packaged and padded, so they came without a scratch.Appearance: The first thing that I noticed when I unwrapped the chairs is that there was some dimpling along the arms of the chairs. I presume that this was from the manufacturing process, when the metal for the arms was bent into shape. The dimpling is not bad, and does not seem to distract from the look of the chairs. Indeed, one doesn&#8217;t expect outdoor chairs to be works of art.That said, though, they are quite attractive chairs, and look great on my deck.Feel: The chairs are nice and comfortable with the webbing for the seat and back hitting in the right spots. Indeed, these are much more comfortable than my old chairs!Construction: The chairs are of a sturdy construction and give you a good feeling of support. I also get the feeling that they will last a good long time. Their weight is about the same as my old chairs, which means that I can easily carry one a long way, or move two around the yard.Conclusion: I think that these are great chairs, and I am very glad that I have them.

Both chairs arrived safe, sound, and unblemished. Although the chairs are of a light, sturdy aluminum make, two stacked together in cardboard are still pretty heavy, so some buyers may want to be home when these are delivered so they get put where you want.The wife and I both love the look of the chairs. They are extremely comfortable, and mesh fabric gives them a strong but airy feel. The arm rests are nicely positioned, and the whole frame has a slight amount of flex to give the chairs a little more of a cushiony feel. The color is nice and will go with just about any outdoor d&eacute;cor. And they are comfortable (did I say that?). Although we haven't sat in them for any appreciable amount of time, I'm confident we'll be able to relax and lounge on our deck with these for some time to come.

Two days later I was sitting at my desk (home office) and I heard this big truck rumbling outside--and they were delivering a giant box to my neighbor. He's a cabinet builder and I just assumed he had ordered another table saw or some other large tool and I watched the truck driver carefully moving this really really big box into his driveway. I thought nothing of it except that the box was *really* big. That night around midnight I went to my front door to see if the snow had begun (I live in Connecticut, we're had a wicked winter) and there was the giant box: in MY driveway! Apparently the driver had put it in the wrong driveway, realized his mistake and moved it to mine. So at midnight I went out in single-digits weather and somehow managed to slide the box up my steps and into my living room alone. (It really wasn't heavy at all, just awkward.) Anyway, as soon as I saw the Amazon label I knew what was in the box.The surprise was that these chairs were shipped fully assembled! I was shocked. I had assumed I'd be sitting around one day with a screwdriver and putting these together myself, but these were completely and beautifully assembled--and they were shipped one nested inside the other. And whoever designed the packaging and whoever packed these chairs deserves a bonus for hard work. These chairs were lovingly and carefully packaged and they slid right out of the bottom of the box with ease. The cats were thrilled at having such a big empty box to play in.The Chairs: As far as the quality of these chairs, they are extremely well crafted and very attractive. The frames (they are double-framed under the seat portion) are extremely strong and they are larger (wider) than a normal lawn chair I think. At least it seems that way. I am not a small person (I'm a little on the wide side, too, lol) and the chairs have plenty of room left over and they are super strong. The woven seat is flexible, it gives a bit when you sit in it (as it should) but the frames are solid as a rock. The backs of the chairs are nicely angled, very comfortable and tall enough to offer good back support.Of course, it's still winter outside here, so the chairs are living in my den for the moment, but I can't wait to put them out in the garden. They're so pretty that I've actually considered using them as indoor/outdoor furniture in my screened porch, but it will be nice to have a solid, very comfortable chair outdoors, so the garden is where they are headed.I've looked at a lot of lawn furniture over the years and these chairs are as well built (or better) as anything I've seen. And I think considering their strength and quality, the price is reasonable.By the way, the cats loved having the giant box for a few days as a castle, but I eventually had to take it away from them."

These chairs are made of a very sturdy aluminum which is powder coated in gray. This means they are totally weather resistant and rust free. The backs and seats are made of a very sturdy tightly woven breathable plastic in colors of gray, tans and beiges. You can leave these outdoors all the time, as the aluminum doesn't rust and the woven seat and back dries quickly being plastic and not fabric.These Sling Chairs are totally one solid piece- non movable parts and stackable for easy storage.  They are very sturdy and supportive and with their high back being 2 feet high from the seat to the top of the back- this gives you full total back support. The seat height from the ground is 18 1/2 inches. The average seat height is 18 inches and for taller people- 19 inches. So, you also get great support for the legs with the seat not being low to the ground. The front seat edge is also curved so the back of your legs get great comfort and not a sharp edge.We have been sitting in these chairs for long periods of time and find pure comfort and support for your back and legs. When they get wet, they dry quickly naturally being made of a tightly woven plastic and aluminum. This makes them very low maintenance. Being stackable, they are easy to put away and take up minimal space in your storage area. The gray/tan/beige colors and sleek design make them very stylish for your yard or patio.These chairs are shipped 2 in a box and are very well padded and protected. The double box is very thick and heavy, but once you unwrap them, the chairs, although very strong and sturdy, are lighter than they look. If you want low maintenance, rust proof, weather resistant, stackable, comfortable, supportive and beautifully stylish chairs for your yard or patio, this set of 5 Star Sling Chairs is for you."

It is made in China, in case you'd like to know that.  Anyway, it does come with a cover so, as it has been my experience, you need to use it if you're storing this outside.  That cast iron usually rusts through within about a year-and-a-half, and the cover extends that to about 2.5 years.  I am storing ours inside from now on as a result.Anyway, this guy has a pretty shallow, small bowl, about the right size to cook a small bit of hamburgers or hot dogs, but if you're looking for a larger fire that will last the evening, you'll be adding firewood frequently.  I still prefer our other one better - you can load a ton of wood (well, almost!) in it and it just burns forever.  This is nice if you just want a short fire for s'mores or for a chilly fall evening.Overall, it's nice, but if you're looking for something to take camping, you'll probably want to look elsewhere - this guy is pretty small and shallow and well, if you're going hunting with the guys over the weekend, they'd probably laugh at this.

When viewed from above, sitting down or standing, the legs hide behind the bowl and don't look nearly as chunky as I imagined. The fire pit is kind of small, two standard length logs side by side just fit in the bowl - there isn't a lot of extra space. If you'd rather not use wood, a standard composite Duraflame fits and works perfectly (this is actually the ideal fuel to use in the pit).Assembly wasn't too difficult. The stainless steel legs attach with the supplied bolts. There is a flat steel wrench included. The spark arrestor cover's handle has to be bolted on, the included wrench does not fit that bolt - hand tight is probably good enough for that handle. The vinyl cover fits nicely and has elastic at the bottom so it won't blow off even in high winds. Of course you put that cover on long after the fire pit has cooled down.The whole pit is not too heavy, around 25 pounds, so one person can carry it. The feet are unique; they have a spring suspension that automatically levels the pit. The teeth in the bottom dig into the ground and make the pit really stable.I was surprised at how good this looks on a patio or in the yard.

This makes it easier to remove and clean. The log grate is extremely important; its function is to improve the airflow. The bowl is a bit shallow, but is able to handle 3-4 logs without trouble.The stainless steel legs are a really nice touch; it gives the fit pit a modernized look. The bowl is very big and roomy; I didn&#8217;t think so at fist when I saw the image. When the top cover is on it stands up to an adults thighs. The cover makes it really safe so children do not get to close to the fire. An ideal location for this pit would be in the lawn or patio area, it really catches the eye and entertains guests. The pit is very durable and can be used for many years as long as it&#8217;s well kept.

I had to get soap and water, and scrub it off. You can still see that it has rust on it. In my opinion this is a toy and it's junk. I can't recommend this. For a product that cost over $250.00, it is a waste of money."

Finally I had the opportunity to try the CobraCo Cast Iron Fire Pit FBCISTEEL.  Now, I have to admit that conditions have been far from ideal. The weather has been mostly quite warm, and I do not have my &#34;chosen spot&#34; prepared for perfect fire pit enjoyment. For reviewing purposes, however, I had to take the first opportunity I had to try it out, at the very least.First I want to say that it is easily assembled and is very sturdy. Also, it is quite attractive in a simple, durable sort of way. I rummaged through my pile wood, provided to me by mother nature over the past months, during some very windy storms. I found enough dry wood and some newspaper and was ready to get started. Since I did not have the time or to be honest the mood to spend hours gazing into the fire on that particular night, I made sure the fire was a small one, and settled in with my (very disinterested) dog to look at fire.Although the timeng was not perfect, I have to say that the short time we spent was relaxing and left me looking forward to having one of those perfect evenings with a fire, and perhaps a friend or two, or maybe a book ( more likely) and my dog, for some quality, relaxing fire time. I am very happy to have had the opportunity to use and review the CobraCo Cast Iron Fire Pit FBCISTEEL. It promises hours of pleasure in the days to come"

It's a smaller fire pit (about 28\" in diameter) than the other fire pits we have, but is good for smaller spaces.  The fact that it is cast iron makes us feel better about roasting food over the fire compared to fire pits with copper bowls.  But is also means it could rust more easily.  We'll update the review with more use to see how it holds up.  For now, a solid four stars."

It only took about 10 minutes to open the box and have it fully assembled. The firepit is of average build quality. The basin is coated in a matte black fire paint that seems to be of only marginal quality. As you touch the basin, dust or residue comes off on your hand. This could also be indicative of just a lack of cleanup as the unit was manufactured. Visually, the unit is modern looking with simple, clean lines. The contrast between the matte black basin and the almost chrome finish of the legs is very nice. The basin is not real deep. I would estimate it could handle approximately three medium sized logs at most. Overall, this is a very functional and nice looking firepit. With the included screen top and poker tool you will have everything you need for a nice fire."

I don't think that this pit will suffer that fate, at least not for a long while.  The bowl is cast iron and bigger than I imagined it to be.  The legs are made of stainless steel and attached easily and securely.  The grate fits in nicely and the lid keeps sparks from drifting away and possibly causing a wild fire.This brings up an important point.  When I was a young boy we used to go camping quite often.  One of the mainstays of our camping site was an open outdoor fire pit.  However, with much of the country suffering from drought it is important to keep fires controlled.  I could see using this fire pit on a camping trip instead of using an open pit since the embers are kept contained by the screen covered lid.  All in all a well made product that is worth it's price."

It's been a few years since I'd last fertilized my lawn because of the damage done to my lawn with burn spots.It took less than 2/3 of the bag to cover my 1/10 of an acre lawn using a spreader. The yellow color of the pellets made it easy to see just how well it spread and there weren't any clumps to break apart.I'd waited until the grass had already turned green after the harsh winter before applying this, not wanting to confuse what nature would have done on its own with the effectiveness of the fertilizer. There were still some patches left where I thought the grass (and even my green weeds) were dead from last year.Well it's not going to suddenly give you this perfect lawn; that will require more effort on my part.  But the lawn is definitely a richer green and thicker than it had been and the brown patches are smaller and showing more signs of life.No burn spots from this application; a definite plus.Amended:  It's been about 3 weeks since the lawn was fertilized and I can only assume that this is why I've suddenly got a yard full of dandelions after we'd spent a lot of time and effort to eradicate them last year.  I'm making that assumption because most of the rest of the neighborhood, including the next door neighbors, have very little of these weeds.  Perhaps it's best to do a weed and feed before applying the fertilizer.Amended:  It's been two months since the application and wow, my lawn has never looked or felt so good.  The lawn is incredibly thick and there are no brown spots left.  I'm the original owner of this house and have been here for thirteen years.  It's not perfect.  I still have various weeds and will continue to work on those, but walking barefoot on this lawn feels good for the first time ever."

It looked certain it would rain, so I put it down immediately.  I used the guide for my spreader and it only covered about 60% of my front yard.  I have a driveway that bifurcates my front yard in the same proportion, so it was easy to see the difference it would make. And it did rain as expected and about three more moderate rains since then.  In my haste, I forgot that I had already put down some 29-0-10 weed and feed fertilizer in some weed infested areas a couple of weeks prior to this fertilizer application.  To be honest, I haven't seen much of a visible effect after nearly three weeks except for the large spot where I used the weed and feed fertilizer. So it is very likely a cumulative effect of this 10-0-6 fertilizer and the 29-0-10 weed and feed fertilizer that led to the very green grass area.The first number is the amount of available nitrogen, the second number is phosphate and the third number is potash. High nitrogen makes for fast green growth, but not necessarily good plant health.  The potash ingredient is there for overall plant health. The clear majority of the weight is filler - usually about 70%. It is all designed to be highly water soluble to get into the soil - or be washed away into the street gutter and into the groundwater supply.Part of my test result was tainted by the prior high nitrogen weed and feed fertilizer application. But it does illustrate the short term effect of nitrogen for a fast growing green yard (but not necessarily a long term healthy yard). This was the first fertilizer application in well over a year, so my yard was probably nitrogen starved. And it is still very early in the growing season following an unusually cold winter to make an accurate assessment. I lost some St. Augustine grass from fungus last year and some from the winter hard freeze. So I needed some high nitrogen fertilizer initially to spur growth to cover the dead areas. But next I'll drop back to a milder fertilizer like this."

SET YOUR CUTTING BLADES HIGHER...............This product has made a visible, positive improvement in the appearance and strength of our lawn:The grass is darker green and more drought resistant.  It is a \"healthier\" lawn, if you will.  The grass is thicker and stronger and crowds out a lot of weeds. In fact, the weeds seem to be repelled. Achieving his lush lawn was relatively simple using a standard fertilizer spreader.This is an organic fertilizer . Here's a brief review of the two major nutrients in lawn fertilizers:Nitrogen (N)Nitrogen is the most important nutrient in lawn fertilization. It helps grow a dense, thick lawn, by stimulating the grass plant growth, and keeps the grass green. This is the lawn food that is depleted most rapidly, but applying too much can create too much top growth and increase the need for mowing.The vivid,  dark emerald green of a lawn can be easily achieved by applying more nitrogen  (caution:  A lot of flowering plants, like peonies, do not want so much nitrogen).Phosphorus (P):Phosphates on the other hand are helpful to strengthen the root system of your lawn. Too much  run-off and leaching of phosphorus used to fertilize lawns can lead to the excessive build-up of algae and weeds in nearby lakes. For that reason, some areas suggest that you limit phosphates in lawn fertilizers to help preserve the local environment and  pose less of a threat to groundwater.  PHOSPHATES MAY EVEN BE ILLEGAL IN SOME AREAS.Mature lawns will have a lower requirement for phosphates.As this fertilizer has 0% PHOSPHATES, It can be a very helpful fertilizer.  Be environmentally friendly, conform to the legal requirements of your local area and still have the best lawn on your block!"

I am sensitive to odors but barely detected any odor at all with this and nothing irritating. I wanted to include the guaranteed analysis details on the bag in this review, but unfortunately they put the barcode sticker right over it and it peeled off when I went to read it so I can't see what it says anymore.*update*It's been about a week and a half since I spread this in our yard and the yard is noticeably greener already and you can tell it is making a difference.*second update*Now it's been almost a month and I'm drowning in green grass! I have to mow parts of my yard with a bagger that I've never had to mow with a bagger before because there was never enough grass growing to need one.  When I say working almost too well...only because of the frequency I have to mow now.  Which is great for how the yard looks, but gives me a lot more mowing to do."

They are baggy on me (of the small hands) but still loose on my husband (of the larger hands). My daughter finds them comfortable as well.I took time to use these while cooking using a cast iron pan, taking food out of the oven, and holding a hot pan while I removed food. They fully covered my hands and were very effective. While there is snow outside, and I can't test them on the BBQ and/or fire pit, the oven has convinced me that these are safe.A couple of uses I often have - I keep a baking stone in the oven and have been known to turn on the oven before removing it. With these, no problem, just need to put the baking stone on a cookie rack so it doesn't crack. On Thanksgiving, I often forget to remove the &#34;extra&#34; metal shelf in the oven that needs to be moved or removed before I can put the turkey in. I have burned my hands doing this - again, these protect fully making this job possible as well.Since I sometimes don't want or need a full glove, I have also grabbed these and used them as hot pads for a quick pick up of a hot item. Even used this way, the silicone texture makes them much more slip proof.The loops inside work perfectly on the loops I have on my stove to hold hot pads, so they are always ready to go.I am grateful to have received a complimentary set to test so that I could write a review and am happy to be able to give them a good rating."

It's a tall muli-rack smokers that gets quite hot and it is a pain trying to use pot holders to move food in, out and around inside it. It's so easy to accidentally drop pot holders, and oven mitts end up being a bit too bulky to use to try and move foods around between the racks. These cooking gloves make handling the trays and foods much easier.They're not bulky like oven mitts, so you can actually hold onto the trays and not end up dipping your gloves inside the food and drippings. And since they are gloves, they stay on your hands and you don't end up dropping them like can happen with small pot holders.These gloves are also great for handling hot home made loaves of bread. You can hold onto the loaf and move it around without burning your hands or tearing it apart like can happen when you try and handle them with utensils.

The fingers make it easy to grip onto handles, the sides of casseroles, the edges of cooking sheets. Sometimes the bulk of oven mitts make it hard to handle these items, not a problem with these gloves. I heated my oven to 500 to put a cast iron skillet in, the skillet didn't even feel warm to me with these gloves as protection. They are usable on both sides so no worries about which hand to put them on.The lines are non skid, and they work! The gloves clamp on the surface of whatever I'm lifting and it feels very secure.They are made with meta-aramid and para-aramid fibers by dupont. I had no idea what that meant, to be honest, so I looked it up. According to my google-fu it's a type of kevlar that is both cut, stab, and heat resistant.If there was one small nitpick it would be that I would like them to be a little longer up the wrist. For me they are fine but as larger hands stretch them out more they are shorter at the wrist and it would just be nice to have them a touch longer, but not even worth a star as in every other way they are great.Thick without being bulky, fingers to grasp, super heat resistant, these gloves are winners in every way.Sample provided"

        "text": "I was interested in the Kuisiware Heat Resistant Gloves for Oven, Grill & Barbecue mainly for use with my gas grill. With temperatures in the single digits lately, I haven&#8217;t been inclined to go outside to grill. What I didn&#8217;t expect was how much I&#8217;d appreciate these gloves for use in my kitchen. I honestly didn&#8217;t believe these would be something I would use much inside, but since I received a pair for review, I decided to try them out with the oven and stove.The first time I used them was while making Chateaubriand. First, I seared it on all sides on the stovetop in my cast iron skillet. The gloves made it easy to handle the cast iron skillet without fear of being burned while also allowing me to handle utensils easily. My pot holders and oven mitts do fine when I want to handle something hot, but it is clumsy trying to handle a cooking utensil while wearing a fingerless oven mitt and using any utensil while holding a pot holder in the same hand is even worse. The Kuisiware gloves&#8217; individual fingers make it easy to hold the pan while stirring, flipping, or performing any other task without need to remove the gloves between each step.I also used them when I cooked asparagus this weekend. I normally seal the asparagus in heavy duty foil, tented a bit on top, and cook it in the oven. While the foil cools quickly, there is still a good bit of steam that escapes when you first open the foil after the asparagus cooks. This was much easier to do while wearing these gloves.I&#8217;ll be using these gloves for most hot kitchen tasks from now on and highly recommend them. The only thing that would make them better in my opinion is if they made them in prettier colors and designs to match my kitchen d&eacute;cor &#8211; or at least so they blend in better."

        "text": "These KUISIWARE HEAT RESISTANT GLOVES provide the complete, flexible protection that my hands need when I'm baking or broiling at very high oven temperatures.  When I use hot pads, I sometimes get burns from oven racks as I'm taking something out of the oven; when I use thick oven mitts, I don't have good control for handling pie dishes, muffin pans, or anything else with semi-liquid contents.These heat-resistant gloves made of knitted fabric allow me to use all five fingers (like thick knitted winter gloves) to handle pans or dishes.  The red silicone bands atop the fabric have the feel of rubber, and grip firmly (like rubber).  I can't vouch for the heat resistance up to 662 degrees F., but I do know that the gloves work well when I bake bread in a 465-degree oven, or broil in a 550-degree oven.A nice feature is that one size fits all.  The gloves are a fairly snug fit for my large hands (men's size small), but they seem to have enough remaining stretch to accommodate even larger hands.  The gloves have the same silicone bands on both sides--thus either glove will fit either hand.  There's never any need to locate the \"left\" or \"right\" glove if you're in a hurry.  The gloves are machine washable, but should be laid out flat to air dry.The accompanying literature includes the following warning:  \"Do not use the glove when wet.  It loses its heat-resistant properties.  Do not use on oily, greasy or wet surfaces.  Do not expose the glove to open fire.  Even though the aramid fibers protect the glove from catching on fire, to prong its life and prevent any accidents, keep it away from fire.  Do not let small children use the glove to play with fire.\"Disclaimer note:  This review is based on a product supplied to me free of charge for review purposes.

However, they even protect the hands when held directly over an open gas flame!They are also very comfortable and completely reversible to be used on either hand, with red silicone grippy lines on both sides. There is even a large hanging loop that tucks inside.These gloves are so much better than any kind of mitt that prevents use of the fingers, pads which don't completely protect the hands, or silicone gloves that don't fit well and also get slippery. They are well-made and are sturdy enough to be used around the shop or in the garage for heat protection.Kuisiware provided a pair of gloves for evaluation and review. I can easily recommend them because they are superior to other types of oven and barbecue gloves, as well as mitts and pads."

They are excellent at scooping up leaves or what you may have laying on the ground after trimming and deadheading.We found they truly excel when clearing away branches that are thorny or prickly, as when we cleared some barberry shrubs that had long outlived their decorative value.A very useful addition in the fight to tame the great outdoors and maintain curb appeal.Note: this item was provided for review purposes (but I'm buying some more as gifts for avid gardeners)."

Rather than use an elastic band to hold the grabber to your hand, the handle is designed so that your hand fits in and can grasp the grabber without the need for any elastic straps. Not only did I find that more comfortable to use, it also made it more efficient &#8211; I could control grasping things easier and could get them off my hands without any problem.The build quality is pretty decent. It&#8217;s all plastic, as expected, but the plastic seems thick enough to stand up to quite a bit of use. I like that the front edge is solid, rather than have &#8220;teeth&#8221; like my other grabbers. I had a much easier time scooping things up with these since there were no gaps for things (mostly twigs and the like) to fall through.They measure 15 inches at the widest point and are about 15 inches long (end to end). The scoop depth is excellent &#8211; it was hard to measure, but I&#8217;d estimate it at about 5 inches deep, which is more than deep enough to hold a lot of whatever it is you&#8217;re picking up. There&#8217;s a slot at the hand end so you can hang them up on a nail in the garage. They also come with a storage bag, which is a nice touch.Zero complaints about these &#8211; it made quick work of picking up a big swath of mulch and debris that got washed out of my planing beds due to a massive rainstorm.In addition to using two of them to grab up leaves and debris, using just one is a great way to speed up smoothing out planting beds or mulch. I love multi functional tools!Great design, solid build quality, and excellent performance. Far better in both comfort and performance than the ones with elastic bands and teeth on the end. Zero complaints, and I would highly recommend these.[Sample provided for review]"

That is a big plus for me because I am basically lazy and these allow me to make shorter work of lawn jobs.I do not get many leaves, but I am forever cutting back bushes and trimming palm fronds. Where these have proven to be perfect is I have an interesting population of snakes in my yard as do many Floridians. My visitors include a coral snake that is not aggressive, but one that I do not want to bite me when I am scooping up debris, fronds and shrub trimmings. And there is always a pygmy rattlesnake or two in the yard. These scoops put some distance between my hands and inquiring fangs, and I suspect that when my yard guests see this looming near them when I am scooping up stuff they quickly move somewhere else.Seriously, these are easy to use and can pick up surprisingly large amounts of debris. It's easy to clean with a hose, and the pair nestles for easy storage, In fact, there is a hanging loop incorporated into the design for maximum convenience.This ships with a thin fabric bag with a logo. It is not something that would work for long term storage, but it certainly handy for other, unrelated uses. But the scoops are the best yard tool that I have come across in a long time.

You can move much more lawn debris per \"handful\", without having to handle the materials directly. For small loads, it's possible to just carry the leaves/clippings/etc directly to the compost pile (or other destination) rather than loading and unloading a container.

These leaf scoops solve the problem.  With one on each hand, you can get a big scoop of leaves, and the direct them into a bag without spilling.  I've found that I can pick up a big pile of leaves and have them packed into a bag for disposal in two or three minutes.  Comparing that to the frustration of trying to brush them into a bag or lift them with a dust pan -- well, there's just no comparison.When I first saw the size of these scoops, I thought they'd be much too large for me to handle, but that's not the case at all.

ReLeaf Leaf Scoops are much larger, and they are cupped to hold a lot of material at once. The handles are easy to grip, and they are designed to help grasp my hands so they are easier to hold onto. I hold the inner handle, and the outer handle holds the back of my hands.  I tried them with and without gloves, and found that they feel better when I use gloves. They pick up everything from large leaves to fine mulch and hold it well until it reaches the target. I was offered a pair of scoops free for an unbiased review, and I'm glad that I have so many good things to say about them.

Perky Pet makes at least one other model which opens on both ends allowing you to clean and fill the glass jar though the larger end. That means that you can use a soapy paper towel (rinse well afterwards with hot water to remove all traces of soap), to clean the bottle rather than having to purchase and use a narrow bottle washer brush.I have four different models, but far prefer the Perky Pet Perky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feeder which has not of the above shortcomings and is a easy to fill and clean.

        "text": "I have 6 feeders hanging in my back yard. The hummers definitely have preferences and, surprisingly, not the ones hanging under the orange tree, but the ones in the open. Their &#34;preferences&#34; are for those that are &#34;flat&#34; rather than a hanging jar, and with a ring-type perch. That said, I wanted something like this to hang from an old planter hanger, and this looked like it would fill the bill.First, I do have a leak, and where it drips, it has attracted wasps. Second, the perch is badly made. It was misshapen when I got it, and though I was able to straighten each one out, they are not at the same distance from each &#34;flower.&#34; In other words, if you have one perch centered under a flower, the next one is off a bit, and the one after that off even more. What's with that? Last, I know that Anna's Hummingbirds weigh only a few grams, but these perches are really flimsy.The only species we have year-round is the Anna's, but April is nesting season. While one would think that this would be when mama is hungriest, it has never been the case for our back yard (this is our 16th year of having feeders). We're lucky to get five or six visits a day, and most of those have been males. This is not a criticism of the feeder. I think it will probably attract them as well as any, though I don't think they'll like the perch. (It's only been up for two days.)IF you hang this where the sun will shine on it, the glass will heat up dramatically, and the nectar will have mold within four days. Considering what nectar (or just sugar) costs today, that will add to the cost of feeding these little guys.I'll leave it hanging for a while, but if the hummers don't like that perch (it's easy to tell), I'll go back to the one it's replacing. If there are dramatic positive changes, I'll post them."

Ants were an issue with my originals, so I purchased separate ant guards which work excellent, that said I was thrilled to see this one had it built in... sadly it didn't work as expected. While the trap seems to work it's very shallow, so it dries out quickly in the sun. The other issue is that I change my hummers nectar frequently, and because of how I have them clipped up I have to tip them a bit to remove them, and if there is any water in the ant trap it pours on my head. I prefer the separate ones for this reason, they are deeper and I stay hanging when I remove the feeder for washing.The best upgrade is that they finally put a wide mouth on the glass bottle, now I can fit a normal sized bottle brush inside and refilling is so much easier and no need for a funnel anymore!All in all an excellent choice, you might want to still consider a separate ant trap though."

        "text": "I've used all sorts of hummingbird feeders over the years and I've probably only 10 or more. The design of this Perky-Pet feeder is really just a duplicate of the standard feeder with all the expected features. This is not, however, to be negative in any way--things become standards because they work. Why re-invent the wheel when you find something that serves its purpose very well?This feeder is easy to fill, though you do feed it by taking off the bottom. I much prefer filling from the top, but that's a very minor issue, you just have to give it a quick flip once you fill it and put the bottom back on. Each of the feeding ports has a built-in bee guard though, to be honest, bees (with this feeder and others) will still try to get some nectar--and sometimes the battles between bees and hummers are kind of exciting. And the top has what they call an \"ant moat\" that prevents ants from getting over the top and getting down to the ports. This feature will only work if you keep the moat filled with water, otherwise, ants can climb right out of it (they are ants after all, they pretty much wander wherever they want.The capacity of the feeder is somewhat minimal, but whether that matters really depends on how many birds you have an how much nectar they eat. If you live in an area that has tons of hummers (like Arizona or Florida) you might want to get a larger capacity feeder. Where I am in New England, as long as I change this and clean it every day or two, it's just fine. Nectar (sugar and water, basically) should be kept fresh anyway because sugar mold forms in old nectar and it is dangerous to the hummingbirds--so, in that respect, smaller is somewhat better, it forces you to clean/refill often.The secret to getting a lot of hummingbirds, I think, is to hang out multiple feeders so that there is less competition, keep the food fresh daily and *wash* the feeders so that the ports run clean, etc. Also, put some red/pink plants nearby to attract the hummingbirds. A big hanging petunia or even an impatient basket will draw them in and help them discover your feeders. Also, keep the feeders close to the house (but not in front of a big picture window--you'll get too many collisions) so that you can watch them. I have my hummingbird feeders right next to a screened porch and the cats are just fascinated.I'd say that overall this is a fine basic feeder and while I'm certainly not a fan of all Perky-Pet products, this one truly is a five-star feeder. I would suggest, however, that you price shop: there are other brands out there that do the exact same thing for less."

Third, I like that the yellow centers bulge outward slightly and have a smaller grid than most, which may help prevent ants and other bugs from entering the feeder. The Feeder has an &#34;ant trough&#34; or moat around the top to prevent ants from getting into the feeder, but on a hot day, the water you put in there won't last an hour, so I'm not sure how helpful that feature will be.The Feeder does come with a packet of nectar, but here's a helpful hint for you. Make your own for just pennies. Use 1/4 cup white sugar to 1 cup of hot water, stir until the sugar is dissolved completely, then allow to cool to room temperature. I make up a quart at a time because I clean and change food frequently. But don't waste your money buying pre-made nectar packets that include red dyes that are probably not good for the birds anyway. Make your own once a week and your birds will be as happy as mine.Overall, an excellent feeder! I highly recommend."

I have no idea if the hummers care, but it sure makes the glass look ugly and dirty.This feeder comes with what they term an ant moat that is supposed to keep them out.  It is simply a shallow dish at the top of the unit that you fill with water.  That will work well if you keep it full, but it does only hold a few ounces of water.  Any improvement is needed and welcome.These feeders always come with &#34;nectar mix&#34; and if you buy it, it is fairly expensive.  All it is is sugar and you can make your own by mixing sugar and water using parts water to one part sugar...being sure to boil the water to kill any microorganisms and not make our tiny friends ill."

The one feeder that we have had just doesn't hold enough and a royal pain to clean.  So glad we were able to get this---it holds plenty of our \"nectar\" and refills a lot less often, very easy to clean.  A  great feature is the \"ant moat\" The top of the feeder has a indentation that you fill with a bit of water, preventing the ants from stealing the nectar....and it works!  After years of feeders in our yard I can honestly say this is a cream of the crop----I'm thinking the hummers agree!  A great product for so much entertainment in our outdoor space!**May 17, 2014...I AM RETHINKING THIS REVIEW, as the feeder is becoming a MAJOR LEAKER!  My wife thought if she were to quit hanging it in a tree (wind causing it to sway), and place it on a stable post, that the leaking problem would be solved...wrong!  Because the plastic bottom is in two parts, it is easy to clean,...but, when putting it back together and screwing it on to the glass jar...it WILL NOT SEAL PROPERLY! Losing all of the Hummingbird solution by leakage is not what we bargained for!!!  We are totally disappointed with Perky-Pet, as we had hoped that this new model would finally be the perfect feeder.  If Perky-Pet could figure out how to attach some type of sealant or rubber ring between the two bottom pieces, that would surely help.  We would like to think that the company is concerned enough to address this issue!!!"

        "text": "UPDATE 5/16/2014:  I'll leave my original review in tact below... but I am going to change this to one star \"cannot recommend\" because the feeder leaks like crazy.  I don't mean just a little leak, I mean red liquid all over the place kind of leak.  At first I thought the birds were just feeding like crazy and that's why the levels were going down... then I saw because it was sitting on a picnic table that the entire table was covered in red gooey sugar water and the feeder had a slow drip.  I'm surprised that Perky Pet would release something like this with a quality problem of this magnitude (it appears other reviewers have experienced this issue as well).  Can't recommend, sorry.ORIGINAL REVIEW:There are lots of great reviews for this feeder already so I'm not sure what I can add, but one thing that I didn't cross my mind when I ordered this large feeder... you have to have a LOT of hummers feeding to consume 30 oz of \"nectar\" before it spoils in the sunlight and heat.  Our hummers are very territorial and fight off others in \"their\" backyard so they can have all the flowers and of course this feeder to themselves.  That results in the nectar going down much more slowly than I would have predicted.As others have stated, this is a great design, with a wide mouth opening on the REAL GLASS (yay!!!) container (dishwasher safe, don't worry about a bottle brush as someone else suggested).  The ant moat seems to work and the bright red color attracts those hummers.  The nectar that comes with this is comically small amount... only 8 oz vs 30 oz capacity of the feeder.  You'll want to make your own with sugar and water (google the recipe) and without any food coloring which is bad for the birds (Amazon also sells clear nectar which is becoming the new norm now).One star off for being cheap with the initial supply of nectar, but overall an excellent feeder that seems design to perform and last.Hope this helps."

With a 30 oz. nectar capacity, this glass hummingbird feeder will assure there's always enough nectar to go around.&#34;...One can never have too many Hummingbird feeders! :)Notes after using the Perky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder with Free Nectar for a couple of weeks:What's not to like about this particular Hummingbird Feeder?First of all, the entire unit is very easy to disassemble and re-assemble. The built in ant moat (red top) and base (with the yellow flower-shaped feeding medallions) screw on/off with ease for cleaning and filling with nectar. The yellow flower medallions fit securely into the feeding base without wobbling or falling out.Cleaning the entire unit is a breeze, and takes very little time -- but, one will need a long bottle-brush (I think Perky-Pet sells these) to reach down into the (glass) nectar holder.The nectar reservoir is made of thick/clear glass, the screw on ant moat/holder and base are made of a very sturdy plastic. The colors are bright and cheery and will probably attract more Hummingbirds -- as opposed to more subdued colors, imo.One fills the nectar reservoir when the unit is upside down, screws on the base and flips unit right side up, then hangs in designated place.  a complimentary packet of  Perky-Pet dry nectar mix is included with this feeder. Easy to mix, and dissolved fast. Just add to 8 oz of water, stir, and pour into feeder. There is no &#34;S&#34; hook included with this feeder for hanging, but there is a place to put one built into the screw on ant moat.  The red cap -- at the top of the unit -- also screws off, providing a flat surface for filling the unit. Nice!A really nice feature, of this particular Hummingbird feeder, is the built in bee guard. Each of the six yellow feeding medallions has a raised center to keep the bees from reaching the nectar. I am hoping it keeps the wasps and hornets away as well -- as I've seen a few sipping nectar from Hummingbird feeders, in the past, that lack this (wonderful) feature. I don't think it will keep the butterflies off, though, as they have very long tongues. *smiles*The ant moat is just a must have, if ya ask Me. Lots of Hummingbird feeders lack this important innovation. Just put plain tap water in it, after hanging the feeder, and let it do its job of keeping the ants away from the nectar, and the Hummingbirds.The feeding station is encircled by sturdy little perches for the little Hummingbirds to rest on as they feed. btw, it is a lot easier to photograph a Hummingbird that is resting on a perch. ijsThe large size, and weight (when filled with nectar), of the Hummingbird feeder, keeps the wind from blowing it back and forth. It is also large enough to be seen from a distance, making it a very nice focal point in the garden or on the patio.*Neighbor-envy... The Hummers flock to my new Perky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder...  *smiles, sips espresso*tip:  this is the nectar recipe I've used for years:  add 1/4 cup of pure cane sugar to 1 cup boiling water -- stir till clear -- let cool -- add to Hummingbird feeder. Change out once a week...Does the Perky-Pet 209B Our Best Glass Hummingbird Feeder with Free Nectar sound like what you may be looking for? :)  Highly Recommended! Would make a wonderful Gift!  --Katharena Eiermann, 2014"

In my case the S hook will not fit over my shepherds hook so I made a little tie out of Marine Twine and that worked great. It is early now for the hummingbirds to be here in great numbers but the scouts are out I have seen one come 3 times to my window. I have no concerns that this will not preform as intended. If I run into any difficulties I will come back and update. I have numerous Perky-Pet Humming Bird feeders I have the best luck with this brand. The sample you get makes 8 ounces.

This is a new model, but it has all the important features I look for in a quality hummingbird feeder--glass, easy hanging (S hook), durability and no leakage.  I like this particular feeder because the wide mouth makes cleaning and filling easy, the base separates in half (again for easy cleaning) and it has built in bee guards and an ant moat.  Most important, hummingbirds like it.  We have over ten different feeders hanging around the yard, and it's obvious which ones are preferred.  Their favorite feeders aren't the fanciest or most expensive, but they all resemble this fundamental glass tube style.UPDATE:  This feeder leaks like a sieve!  It held liquid just fine for about a month, but now the two-part base just doesn't seal.  I checked reviews, and sure enough, lots of other people are experiencing the same problem.  Leaking renders the 209B feeder useless...my five star review has been revised to one."

I love that it has an ant moat to keep those pests away.  The small hook is nice as well and the sample pack of nectar.  I make mine with just sugar and boiled water; one cup of sugar to four cups of water, or make half that amount if needed.I have noticed that some of our smaller hummingbirds seem to have to really reach for the feeding hole if they are sitting.

        "text": "Hummingbirds are some of my favorite tweets and as a consequence I've acquired a number of Perky-Pet feeders. One reason I like them is that they're affordable, and I've been able to get replacement parts like bee-guards which have kept my older feeders useful and clean.This current Perky-Pet model, the 209B, is really nice. It's got an ant moat at the top and little rails for the Hummers to rest on all the way around.  One of my favorite features though is the ease of cleaning and filling.  Cleaning is particularly important because while making a mess is just my problem (one that can easily be corrected), an unclean feeder can make the birds sick.The wider mouth glass battle on this unit makes filling and cleaning easy.  The glass bottle also threads into the base like a regular bottle/cap arrangement which has kept leakage to a minimum for me.Cleaning the base is easy as the bottom comes apart in two pieces, and I've found that if you take most of the fuzz off of a Q-tip that you can scrub the inside of the flowers, keeping them clear of debris and slimy buildup.The only downside would be the red dye in the sugar Perky Pet supplies. No one recommends food dye any longer. Use it --if you must-- but then use just regular sugar and water to provide nutrition to the birds.  The formula couldn't be easier. 1-cup cooled-boiled water or bottled water (without fizz or chlorine or additives of any sort) and 1/4-cup white regular sugar.  Mix and serve.This is a HUGE feeder, by the way, and I only fill mine with 1-cup of sugar-water because we don't get that many hummers (unfortunately too near the woods) and in the heat of summer it will go bad in a couple of days.  You might want to do the same too.Happy feeding."

        "text": "I've had many bird feeders over the years, and Perky-Pet nearly always rises to the top of the list.  They have many variants in their hummingbird line--some perhaps oriented more toward the humans that hang them than the birds that depend on them--but this one's a winner.  It's more in their classic line (my term, not theirs).  Perky-Pet fiddles with their designs a little bit from year to year.  This year they've widened the mouth of the glass container.  Not only is this easier to fill than previous years, but it's also much easier to clean.  This does mean that you've got to move a little faster when you invert the unit to hang, but the tradeoff is worth it.  There's an ant trap on top (that will dry out in a couple of hours in my climate) and a supposedly bee-resistant flower.  Won't know how well that works until yellow-jacket season arrives.The real test is the birds.  It's the very beginning of hummingbird season in this part of the Rockies, so the birds haven't arrived in numbers.  But it didn't take our first Blackchin more than an hour to find this one.I've only got one complaint and that's the fact that only a small hook is included for hanging.  It's far too small to hang on the wrought-iron hooks than many of us hummer-fanciers prefer.  A short length of chain would have been a better choice."

        "text": "We have several hummingbird feeders in our yard and are always on the lookout for another one to add to help provide multiple areas for the birds to go which helps cut down on the territorial behavior enough to allow more than one bird to use the feeders (too many to defend). We saw this feeder and thought that we would give it a try. Here is what we liked:1. This feeder is VERY easy to clean and to fill!! Some feeders are so small that it is difficult to get a brush up into them to keep them clean. This is very important since a sugar solution in sunlight and heat spoils quickly and can make the birds sick.2. The color definitely attracts them. There is NO need to use colored solution and it is actually better not to since the dye is not good for the birds. The bright color of the feeder itself is enough to attract hummingbirds.  Should also note that the amount of nectar included with this will NOT fill the feeder.3. If you have problems with bees or ants, this feeder us setup to help you keep them at bay. The clever trap for ants at the top and the bee guards do a very nice job!!4. This feeder holds more than enough food to be able to supply a large number of birds before you would need to clean it out anyway. We found that if we fill it about 1/3 full, it was enough for the birds to go through most of it before it was time to clean it out. Depending upon the amount of sun and heat, it takes 3 to 6 days for the liquid to start to cloud up and to require replacement. ALWAYS clean your feeder when you change food!!Things that we did not like as much:1. The perch is much better than some of their other styles, but is still sort of a pain to keep aligned. It is really necessary, probably not, but the birds will take advantage of it if it is there.  Being a one piece circle does make it easier to align.2.  This unit is WAY too large, at least in our area.  The hummingbirds in our area do not usually allow others to feed at the same time, thus it takes quite a bit of time to go through the amount of nectar that this unit will hold.  If, however, you happen to live in an area where several will share a feeder at the same time, this may work out for you.All in all, this is very well made product that works as it should. One quick note, any feeder will leak if it is in high winds!!! When the winds were less than 12 mph we did not find any issue with leakage."

This extra large 30 ounce container needs more than 8 ounces of nectar, obviously. Including enough mix for at least the first fill of the feeder might encourage the buyer to buy this brand of nectar mix next time. It has not been visited as yet. Alas, the neighbor who bragged about seeing a hummingbird was misled. The sweet little guys returned at last this weekend. I have only seen one, but everyone who feeds these birds knows that they are elusive to view and difficult to photograph, which is my aim, of course! This is a great feeder because it holds more nectar than most and has convenient features to discourage the ants, bees and bugs that try to haunt these feeders.

That's quite a qualified statement, so it's hard to argue that this is Perky Pet's best glass feeder (as opposed to their other glass feeders, or their other plastic feeders). The glass cylinder gives it a good appearance, and its 30 ounce capacity should supply the needs of all but the most hungry hummingbirds.I didn't have any issues with leaking in the four weeks that I've been using the feeder, as has been mentioned in other reviews. The base comes apart, making cleaning easy, unlike their super-sized 48-ounce feeder that I also tested. The neck of the glass cylinder is a bit narrow, so you will need a bottle brush or some practice with swishing a wettened paper towel or cloth to get the inside surface cleaned. The red plastic cap has a loop for the supplied S-hook, and it can stand inverted on a flat surface so that it can be filled without tipping.This feeder comes with a small packet of nectar concentrate, and I would advise tossing it in the garbage and mix up a fresh batch of nectar by boiling water and mixing four parts water with one part sugar. This is the recipe most recommended by experts, and it skips the unnecessary and possibly harmful red dye. I know that Perky Pet says on the label that it won't hurt the birds, but it's not necessary to have red juice, so why add the dye and take the chance?For a cylinder-style feeder, this is a decent unit. However, I still like the dish-style feeders that are available from Aspects under the name &#34;Hummzinger&#34; here on Amazon. Wild Birds Unlimited sells the same type. These are hands-down the best feeders I've ever used, so while this feeder might be the best glass feeder sold by Perky Pet, it's not the best overall hummingbird feeder in my opinion.Even given that fact, I'm giving this a four-star rating, because it does have some good features and I didn't run into any major issues. I would spend my money on something else, but if this type of feeder appeals to you, I think you will like it."

The opening is wide, making it easier to fill up (no need for a funnel). It has an ant moat. The perch looks pretty flimsy (plastic) but has held up so far.

The instructions tell you to hand wash with soap and water twice a week.  Being lazy and in order to test it, I ran the whole thing through the dishwasher on the top rack.  The glass was fine.  The perches got a little bendy, I probably will not send that part through again.  Because these things need to be cleaned all the time, and it&#8217;s hard to get into the little crevices in the flowers I wish it was dishwasher safe. However,  een if you have to hand wash, it comes apart easily for cleaning but you will still need a tiny brush to clean out the holes.  I LOVE that you can stand it on end to fill, this is a huge plus, no more trying to hold the feeder in one hand and fill with the other.  The flowers also have a little tube that sticks up on them, this does seem to dissuade the bee&#8217;s, but not stop them altogether.The ant moat is too shallow  to be effective here in New Mexico, after three hours all the water had evaporated.  I hang my feeders from plastic bell shaped hooks (type plastic bell ant guard) anyway because all the water moats I have ever tried dry out too quickly.Within minutes of hanging this feeder  (replacing a Dr. JB&#8217;s feeder) there was a black chinned hummingbird partaking.  My usual standby feeders are the Dr. JB Clean Feeder, because they hold a LOT of nectar ( I have one that holds 80 oz) and they can been thrown in the dishwasher.  However, they are much more expensive than these feeders, more than twice as much.  I had both hanging up for a day and did not notice any difference in which one they chose.  I would post a photo, but it appears that we cannot do that anymore.Here is how I make nectar (that red stuff is not supposed to be good for the hummingbirds and it costs too much).  I use a plastic bottle that juice came in (like cranberry juice) onto which I have sharpied a line which is one quarter of the volume (this makes a sweet solution, you can also do one fifth).  Fill up to that line with sugar.  Add very hot water (not quite boiling) leaving a little air space, the water that comes out of my faucet near my hot water heater is actually hot enough.  Put on the lid and shake.  Faster and easier than boiling up a solution every time.  Store extra in the frig.  You can even run the juice bottle through the dishwasher to clean it between making nectar."

Miracle-Gro makes their soils with a heavy content of peat, rather than composted peat or true organic matter which has broken down into soil or is about to. The content of most MiracleGro soils is about 2/3rds peat and the rest is some organic matter which is not quite broken down, a bit of dark soil (to help color the mix darkly), Vermiculite to help keep it fluffy and chemical plant food.While this mixture is GREAT for container plants (container gardens, house plants, seed trays, etc.) where you have a controlled micro-environment, I feel that in general MiracleGro products are not a good to put into the ground. Bag soils from this company can get too dry in hot weather, the chemical fertilizers included are not organic and tend to kill off naturally active insects and other soil creatures which actually help break down nutrients and make them easier for roots to take up. If you see a MiracleGro garden where someone has been heavily using that product, you'll see a garden where there are few earthworms because the pH is not right and the chemicals make them retreat. As well, once you get trees, shrubs and perennials used to chemical fertilizers, those flora will always depend on them because you've scared off the natural things that help them grow. It's basically addictive and harmful for the earth.Keep it in containers and you can't go wrong."

I don't do that until May, but this review is due in 14 days, so I hope to provide an update at a later time.My first comment is about the price.  I think it's fantastic.  You get quite a bit for $6.  I can't get Miracle Gro brand this cheap at Walmart where I live.  And I really do believe that Miracle Gro provides high quality soil and nutrients.  (Not to mention, I love the smell)So far, I have used to product to plant some chicks and hens and some succulents in little bowls and pots throughout the house. They are thriving and looking gorgeous.So...so far, so good!  I plan to use the remaining product for my flower pots of wave petunias, sweet potato vine, and Gerber daisies.  I imagine I will need one bag per pot...they are about 25 inches wide and I'm unsure of how deep."

It comes in the standard 1 cubic foot bag like other soils which helps it to stack well with the rest of my garden bags.  I followed the directions on the bag making a 3 inch layer of this garden soil and working it into the top 6 inches of my top soil.  The directions are slightly different for raised beds or for individual plants. But basically it ends up being a 50/50 mixed of this garden soil and your top soil.  I like that the nitrogen, phosphate, calcium and sulphate ingredients are coated which allows them to slowly release over time.  I think this may help them not to pollute the ground water and that makes it good for the environment. My flowers have already grown a noticeable 25% or more which has really helped to make my house look great.  Since they are still growing, by the time growing season is over I hope to get twice the growth like the bag says will happen..  I may need to adjust something in my soil preparation or watering.  I will keep experimenting.  But I am super pleased with the nice flowers I have now already.  I would recommend this soil for anyone wanting to more growth from their plants without trying to wade through the confusing world of fertilizers since the ratio of nutrients are already figured out for you in the bag."

Since I don't tend to fertilize my plants and garden myself, the addition of the fertilizer in the soil is helpful.The soil is easy to work with and pot my plants in.The one thing I didn't like was all of the random bits in the soil - twigs, sticks, what looks like wicker pieces, mulch etc. It's obviously composted from other material, which is OK, but I didn't care for the un-broken down pieces in the mixture. I feel like it's filler material they add so they can get away with selling less actual product.Everything I have planted in this soil is doing well - no problems and no complaints. I was able to pot several of my herbs with this one bag; about 25 of my seedlings were moved to 4\" pots and I still had a bit of soil left over.Price is decent, too!"

I used the Miracle-Gro Garden Soil for this year's hibiscus.  I didn't have any gnat/maggot/bug problems others have mentioned.  Nor did I have a lot of rocks/bark/sticks.  It's always weird when you read reviews for a product that are nothing like what you've experienced.So, the hibiscus is alive and well and putting out leaves and flowers just as it should.  The soil holds water very well without being waterlogged.I'm happy with it for using in potted plants.  I will note, however, that I would never use this in my garden beds, especially for vegetables, herbs or flowers that I was going to consume as I only use organic materials from local, reputable sources or my own compost or worm castings for that purpose."

If you grow the same thing in the same place every year, you are drawing the same nutrients out of the soil every year. Miracle Gro Garden Soil is one way to restore those nutrients to your garden. It also loosens your soil, improves it moister retention and provides 3 moths of plant food to the plants growing in it.This is what you need if you plant a garden every year to insure your garden grows to its full potential."

I put my hands into it, and it felt good, that mix of firm and soft that good soil has.  It was perfect to help top up the soil on the raised planter that's getting the three sisters treatment (corn, snap peas, and a mix of pumpkins and melons) this year.Now obviously, a proper review of gardening soil like this doesn't come when I plant my vegetable garden in the spring -- it comes when I harvest vegetables in the summer and fall.  So call this preliminary, and if I run into any unexpected problems, I'll be back to update my review.The one thing about this, like other Miracle Gro products that puts me off is price.

At about an inch-and-a-half tall I put the seedlings in larger containers, half with the local nursery medium and half with the following mixture. On the bottom I put this outdoor mix, since we don't plant tomatoes outside here until June, and it will set the roots in something suitable for outdoors. The top couple inches of soil is a 50/50 mix of the starter mix andMiracle-Gro Moisture Control Potting Mix, which has more fertilizer and adds water retention, since seedlings are so sensitive to drying out. (The fertilizer in this mixture has more nitrogen than they'll get once they're planted outside.)They're doing great in this mixture, with more than twice as much leaf growth as the ones in the local nursery medium.This product looks like a rough peat mix, with a few under-one-inch wood pieces. The main ingredient is listed as any or all of peat, processed forest products, coir (coconut husk fibers), and/or compost. The other listed ingredients are sphagnum peat moss, a wetting agent (to help soak in water), and fertilizer: .09 - .05 - .07 NPK, polymer-coated for slow release over three months. (Keep in mind that the NPK composition of growth medium and soil cannot be directly compared to that of fertilizer additives, which are a lot more concentrated so they can be diluted in the soil.)"

Now, I'm longing to make some hypertufa planters again, but I live in an apartment that doesn't have a patio or deck and buying and storing huge bags of aggregate is not possible. I also have to be more concerned about making a mess. I have to do things on a smaller scale than I used to.A basic hypertufa recipe is 1:1:1 Portland cement, perlite, and peat moss mixed with about 1 part water. (Vermiculite is sometimes used instead of, or in addition to, the perlite; google hypertufa recipes online.) I was pleased to see that Lowe's has a beginner's hypertufa how-to online that calls for using this 8-quart size of perlite. That makes it easier to make up a small batch of hypertufa without having loads of ingredients left over you have to store. Perlite is very lightweight, so hypertufa pots are lighter in weight as well.This size is going to allow me to indulge my creative side, so I'm happy about that. And if I wind up not doing it after all, I've got what I need to loosen up soil in my pots, which is what most people use perlite for."
