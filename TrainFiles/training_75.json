I haven't cut the outside yet.- This hose has been in full sunlight for more than 3 months, and the rubber hasn't cracked yet! I believe it's good quality rubber.cons:- Like with every hose, keeping it outside in the sunshine, the water warms up and starts smelling.My dog don't want to drink from the water coming from this hose.- The hose is only in one color (I wished it was a little less visible in the gardenOtherwise this hose is an excellent garden tool!I bought 2 of them, one 25ft for my front garden, and 50ft for my rear garden.3-4months and still in excellent condition!"

Of course, it's very favorable that they don't leak.  But what particularly impresses me about them is their notably light weight and flexibility, which make them a lot easier to handle than my previous hoses.  The flexibility diminishes in cold weather, but a garden hose is less useful then anyway.They're not especially prone to kinking, but they're not kink-proof, either, nor do they claim to be.  They kink a lot less than one of my old hoses and more than a couple of others, but the latter were fairly stiff, so there was a trade-off.Bottom line:  this was a good purchase."

        "text": "After using this hose I will never go back to small diameter garden hoses.  The water flows with much more force, which is especially useful when using the jet nozzle.  Most garden hoses are only 1/2\" diameter, and some premium hoses are 5/8\", but this is 3/4\".There is a significant water pressure loss with regular hoses because the smaller diameter means that more of the water is in contact with the walls, plus it flows at higher velocity further increasing the friction.  You'd be amazed looking at the charts, just how much pressure is lost with the cheap standard hoses.  For example:I'm looking at a plastic pipe friction head loss chart.  At 5 gallons per minute, the pressure friction head loss per 100 ft is 5.3 ft for a 3/4\" pipe (same size as this hose).  For a 1/2\" (regular hose size) pipe the head loss is 20.7 ft - that's 4x less height that the water can travel merely because of friction from the smaller inside diameter!I also noticed, this hose also has less tendency to kink."

So investing in a really good quality hose didn't make that sense to me.  The only flaw in that logic is cheap hoses have a habit of breaking and leaking just sitting there on the reel, whether you use them or not.  So in the long run you don't save much.  That, and the fact that cheap hoses also make you feel like you are wrestling a snake when using them for they are so stiff and kink like crazy.  When I decided to buy a better hose I came across this one and liked it immediately.  It's very well made and just about as flexible a hose you can buy without going for one of those new fangled shrinking hoses.  (I'm not sold on the long term quality of those).  This thing is a pleasure to use, as well as making it much simpler a task of rolling it up when you're done.  It kinda reminds me of what my cheap hose felt like when it was sitting out stretched in the sun for a while.  It would feel much softer and more flexible.  Something this does with or without sun.  Though its true that getting that flexibility carries with it a little more weight in the hose itself, its such a pleasure to use that I feel the trade off is well worth it.  It only takes a short time to get used to it being a little heavier anyway, and I love being able to roll it up on the reel when done so easily.  A top notch hose that carries a generous amount of quality, convenience, all for a fair price that I highly recommend... : )"

        "text": "I've been in the Landscape Industry for over 60 years and have owned my own company for 23 years. One of the odder phenomenons I've experienced is that client's will spend $1,000 on a garden sculpture or $100 for a bottle of wine for a garden party but then they turn into Scrooge McDuck when it comes to sinking ANY SUM OF MONEY into the items required to properly care for the garden!Gimmicks abound in any industry but it seems that in the Green Industry, a Fool and Their Money is Guaranteed to Be Parted! Curly hoses, shrinky hoses, pink & purple hoses...the very item that delivers Life Giving Water is dismissed and ignored and people insist on spending the LEAST amount of money on a hose. Aside from the very important matter of a hose needing double walls to withstand the constant P.S.I. (pounds per square inch), a good hose also needs to have solid brass couplings, and have enough plys to avoid kinking.THIS hose delivers! Yes, there is heft to it's weight...that's what you NEED from a quality hose! And, it refuses to kink, even when you try to kink it as a test. I've bought Gilmour hoses for clients and my own company's use for over 17 years and NEVER needed to replace a single one! The 25 foot length is excellent to extend a longer hose for occasional use, rather than dragging that extra length around your property 24/7. Also, for very small Urban Gardens, rarely do you need more than 15 feet of hose so the 25' length is perfect for city gardens or roof top decks.Here are some tips from someone that works for a living with garden hoses:1) Use a cheap rope that you pick up at the Dollar Store to get the MAXIMUM LENGTH of hose you need. Mark that length down. Then, using the same rope, measure the NORMAL LENGTH that you will need on a daily/weekly basis. If the difference is more than 10 feet, BUY TWO OR MORE HOSES! Yes, I know that sounds insane but hear me out.If on a daily basis, you only need a 50' hose to reach your 40' garden, WHY are you buying a 100' hose to drag around? If you only need that additional 25 or 50 feet for the few times you wash your car or windows or fill a pool, buy some quick-connects and the extention hose length that you'll only use rarely. Hoses come in 10', 25', 50', 75', 100' and 150' length; ONLY buy the shortest length you need 90% of the time and then an additional hose to attach when needed.2) To coil your hose easily whether you store it on the ground or on a hose wheel, turn OFF THE WATER and keep the nozzle OPEN to drain the pounds and pounds of water that are trapped inside the hose! If you hate getting dirty hands, use garden gloves to coil it up and using the natural curl of the hose, just continue to coil it, turning the hose as needed.3) During the Summer, attach a PLASTIC SHUT OFF VALVE to both ends of the hose: the one connected to your home's spigot and also to the nozzle of choice. WHY? Because plastic does NOT corrode like any metal will do and if you have high minerals in your water, there are times that the hose coupling will actually become permanently corroded to the spigot or nozzle, making it completely impossible to remove! I know that we're taught that Metal=Good and Plastic=Bad but trust me...when I have to tell a client that they either need to replace a $70 hose or hire a plumber to remove a sealed/corroded coupling, that $2 dollar plastic gate valve becomes priceless!4) ALWAYS DRAIN YOUR HOSE, DETACH THE GATE VALVES AND STORE YOUR HOSE, VALVES AND NOZZLE IN A FREEZE-PROOF AREA!!! If I don't do it for my client's and trust them to do it, it never gets done. And after the first hard frost, trapped water in nozzles, hoses and valves expands and can destroy all of the above in one night. It takes less than 30 minutes to winterize two hoses and attachments; figure out the cost of replacing everything in Spring when you find them all destroyed!5) One of the best ways to RUIN ANY HOSE, is to tug-tug-tug at the coupling, which breaks the weld and suddenly you have a leak that can't be fixed! I simply make a small loop in the end that attachs to the house which acts as a \"brake\" and takes the pressure off of the coupling and spigot.I only recommend landscape items that I trust to use with all my employees and on all my jobs. When I gain new clients, I teach them the benefits of a good hose and order it for them, never having to do it again. Buy one less bottle of good wine and use that cash for your hose. You won't be sorry! :)"

        "text": "Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years--manufactured in a dozen companies--and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  You can get \"prettier\" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if \"pretty\" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.THUMB SCREWNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.LOCK-ON LOOPNotice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a \"lock on\" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.NOT A VALVEOne reviewer complains that there is no \"medium\" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual \"problem\", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is \"too good\"---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a \"closed\" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offor aGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then \"open 'er up\" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERSMany reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT \"Gilmour 572TF\".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in \"bargain bin\" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a \"Gilmour 572TF\", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don't get exactly the product described.  I'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the \"Gilmour 572TF\", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.CAVEATSHere in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle.  These are virtually indestructible, and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it.> Those \"prettier\" versions of the zinc nozzle with plastic handles I mentioned may be more pleasant to use in the winter, and might get the wife's approval.  Often these are only 50 cents or so more than the 573TF, and in that case are clearly better choices.Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red,Gilmour Comfort Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 593 Black,Gilmour 572 Insulated Pistol Grip Nozzle.> High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S> There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $1--$2 in \"bargain bins\", which are a good deal for the price, but are not nearly as durable, and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer.> There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front---but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve.  You'd be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above.  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red> If you (or your wife) insists on a \"pretty\" nozzle with s electable spray patterns, I suggest the hybridGilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/Tealor Gilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584.  One setting is the full-action, and there are several selectable patterns.NERD CORNERThe zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will \"sacrifice\" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.  I know this for a fact---my wife keeps buying them---indeed we have a bin of discarded (mostly still functional) \"pretty\" sprayer nozzles, which have \"fallen out of favor\" for various reasons."

Convenience alone makes this sprinkler really attractive, but it does a good job and that is a real draw.Operation is easy. Extend the garden hose where you want to water as the hose is the 'track' that the Raintrain runs on. By adjusting the time and the pressure you essentially control where you water and the degree of water used. Then sit back and enjoy as  the Raintree does the work.  No more moving the sprinkler or possibly getting showered. It doesn't get much simpler.The spray is low and slow so everything gets watered more effectively and there is less evaporation.

It's definitely sturdily built, and with a steel body, it appears nearly indestructible. Because it's a &#34;traveling&#34; sprinkler, once you have it set and have placed the hose in the middle of the track you want it to cover, it will move on its own and give a wide area of lawn a thorough sprinkling. One doesn't have to run out every little while to move the sprinkler so that it can water another patch of ground. Also, there's a little ramp you can run the hose through so that when the sprinkler has completed its intended course it reaches the ramp and shuts off on its own. This is particularly useful if you're not going to be around to monitor it.Now, a couple less positive features. First, this is an appropriate sprinkler only for those parts of the lawn that are relatively wide open and devoid of obstacles. We have a number of large trees in both our front and back yards. Also, we have tree rings and the like, which mean that parts of our lawn are isolated from the rest. We need a second sprinkler to cover these parts. So, buy this only if you have a large enough amount of open space to make having one worthwhile.Second, it is a very heavy sprinkler. I realize that this is the price one pays for a large metal object. But if you want a light-weight piece of equipment, this isn't it."

I was initially very enthusiastic about it, but over time, I grew less satisfied with it.Pros:>For some reason, it's mesmerizing to watch.  After I get it set up, I always watch for a few moments to make sure the water throw is adjusted properly, and then I find myself watching it longer than necessary.  There's just something cool and relaxing about how the arms spin and the wheels turn and how it slowly moves along.  From talking to some other people who own this and similar products, \"sprinkler watching\" seems to be a common phenomenon.>The coarse spray is ideal for use in windy areas.  You'll get a lot less drift and evaporation using this than you would with a finer-droplet sprinkler.>The adjustability is impressive.  I have a long, 4-foot swatch of grass that would be difficult to water with most other sprinklers, but on the Raintrain, I can point the arms way down and keep the water where I want it.  But I can also point the arms way up and throw the water for at least 50 feet.>It's quiet.  The only sound it makes is the water hitting the grass.>The shut-off feature is very handy and worked quite well (initially).>It stands up well to neglect.  I left both my sprinkler and the stop block sitting outside in the sun and snow all winter, and come spring, they seemed no worse for wear.  Also, you are supposed to disconnect the sprinkler and let it drain after each use, and I've never done that, with no apparent effect yet.Cons:>This thing is really heavy, as it needs to be, but when you're hauling it out to the north forty (okay, the back of a 6500-square-foot lawn), it's a little cumbersome.>The hose connection is awkwardly placed.  It's in the somewhat narrow space at the back between the wheels, so I find it a little difficult to get a good grip on the connector.  There are also two inexplicable protrusions in the body of the sprinkler right next to the connector, and this makes it even harder to grip.  This is why I never drain my sprinkler like I'm supposed to; I hate connecting it.>The connector always leaks, even after I put in a gasket, and the hose sometimes loosens while it's traveling.>Getting the water to throw just the right distance is a pain.  You have to turn on the water, see where it's throwing, turn it off, walk out to the sprinkler, adjust the arms, walk back to the faucet, turn it on, see if that's right, and then repeat until you have it where you want it, which might involve several tries.>The water is thrown in a circle, but only to the outside of the circle.  This is easily seen if you have the sprinkler set where it will be thrown on concrete.  You can see the arc of the circle and the dry area inside it.  The way the Raintrain gets all the ground covered is by advancing this outline through the yard.  For this reason, the stationary setting on the sprinkler is useless.  It will water the outline of the circle only.>Because of the circle outline problem, the area at the beginning and end of the course will get half as much water as the rest of the yard (the beginning of the course will only be hit by the trailing edge of the circle, and the end of the course will only be hit by the front edge).  To compensate for this, I turn off the water, pick up the Raintrain, and move it back at both the beginning and end so that the areas get covered by the half circle twice.  This creates a lot of extra work for what I was hoping would be a labor-saver.>I found that the Raintrain doesn't deliver nearly as much water as it says it will.  The farther you throw the water, the less depth of water you'll put out (because the same amount of water is being spread out over a bigger area), but when I had the arms adjusted for a pretty narrow path, I only measured about a quarter inch of water (even on \"low gear,\" which makes it travel more slowly).  This likely explains why I've struggled so much with keeping my lawn green since I got the Raintrain.  With stationary sprinklers, you can leave them running as long as necessary to achieve the water delivery you need.  But with the Raintrain, if you need more water than it delivers, your only option is to lay out the hose again and start it over, which is a lot of extra work.>While the sprinkler seems overall pretty solid and durable, I knocked a big chip of paint off the \"nose\" when I set it up on end to attach the hose, and the bare spot rusted immediately.>Laying out the hose for a straight line is simple, but if you want to do any curves, it takes a lot of practice and trial and error to create a path that won't make the Raintrain \"jump the track.\"  The tightness of curve it can handle depends on several factors, such as the height and density of the grass, the softness of the ground, and any small bits of yard debris the wheels might go over.>The stop valve on the underside (which is triggered by the stop block) stopped working on mine during its second season.  Now when it runs over the stop block, it slows down, and the arms start turning more slowly, but it doesn't actually stop.  This greatly reduced the handiness of the Raintrain for me.Overall, this is a fun sprinkler, and it has its uses, but I've decided to try something else this summer.  The Raintrain is just too cumbersome and time-consuming to set up for my particular needs."

The only problem is if it hits a soft area of the yard, the wheels can sink in and it gets stuck.  You certainly can't just set it and forget it.  It needs to be babysat every half hour or so to ensure it is still moving."

I am a college student and stay at home dad, I don't have the money for a high water bill.Second complain is that's it a heavy piece of metal and I don't understand why it needs to be so heavy. I don't mind lifting weights but I don't wanna lift while I'm working in my grass, this is an expensive sprinkler and I'm not leaving it outside at night so carrying this inside every night is somewhat of a hassle.Pros- I like the coverage it gets, it covers a lot of space and it left me having to only use it a few feet of hose.Setup was pretty simple, I can recall a few times adjusting the sprayers and running off getting my pants soaked lolOverall I give it a B- I think you should just stick with your regular sprinkler, save yourself the hassle and skip this purchase"

We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem.  First of all, this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move.  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects, get something else.  It has to be moved.  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction.  I have found I have to check on it as often, if not more often, than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler.  First, it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence.  Then, it kinked the hose and cut off the water.  Finally, it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels.  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water.  No kink this time, checked the button on the bottom, couldn't get it going again.  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler.  At least it's easy to move around.  I think you need to use this on a very flat, very straight lawn.  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves.  It didn't work for me.  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move."

It is very effective in watering the lawn, without  spraying water high up in the air (less chance for evaporation, and not  affected by wind as much), and it has hands-off operation once you set it  up.Adjusting the spray diameter is easy, and using the hose as a way to  set the travel path for the sprinkler to follow is a great idea.  The  adjustable speed allows you to decide how much water to apply and how much  ground you want to cover in a period of time.Inspecting the yard  afterwards shows that the ground is nicely saturated, and not needing to go  out and move hoses is a welcomed change. This sprinkler is worth the  purchase price!"

I can now get as small as about 2 1/2 feet to around 40 feet. What's cool is that they can be adjusted or I can use combination of any of the arms. For instance, I will use one of the original with one of my new ones. The new one will get the center which the originals don't do that well. I drilled 1/16 inch holes which are plenty large enough. See my photos for a better idea.----------------------------------------------------------Unfortunately it's a little early for us to be watering here in the NW. In fact, we don't always need to water except we set a record last year for something like 80 days straight with no rain. But even in July and August the rain is limited so to keep things green and the garden growing we need to water. Sprinkler systems being too expensive for how often we use them sprinklers like this can be a time saver if they work.I tried it out and it did work. I found I could get down to about a 5 foot width by turning the heads down. But you are limited how far to turn them down or they will hit the tractor.The sprinkler heads need to point a certain direction or it will go backwards...I thought high speed was perfect for my needs. Fast enough I watched it travel 5 feet for my test and it shut off as expected.It does look cool and is fun to watch!Over having to move a sprinkler this really is awesome and compared to a sprinkler system the cost is great. I didn't open it up but if it does indeed have plastic gears how long will it last? As often as I will need it here it may last me a long time. Hopefully a decent investment."

        "text": "I own a yard where either the person who planted the trees or the one who ran the irrigation pipes needed a few more lessons about what happens ten years later when that 6' tree becomes a 25 footer and the roots are wrapped around the pipe that was laid 12\" away from it.Because of a variety of issues from shallow topsoil with an uneven granite underlay to existing water/sewer/power lines to heavy tree and root growth, new pipes just aren't in the cards.  Every year I turn on the sprinkler system and start fixing busted pipes and sprinkler heads that have been pushed off by a root.  I've been very lucky so far, I've been able to repair all but one of them.  Once I found myself up to my armpit in a hole not much bigger than my arm, through dense roots where I managed to glue a new pipe piece in.Clearly this sort of stuff takes a lot of time to fix sometimes, and in the meanwhile hand watering my half acre in 100 degree, 0% humidity summers is just a no-go.Enter the Rain Train, because its time to make it rain! :)You lay out a hose path for this, no sharp turns, and only on grass not on pavement or any other type of surface as this may destroy the gears in the unit.  Place the little yellow plastic ramp over the hose where you want it to stop, and insert the metal rod in the ground to hold it.  Turn on the water and set to high or low (high goes faster, disperses less water per square inch) and go do something else for a while.  You can adjust the two spray wands to an angle that gives you the desired coverage, then use the faucet to fine tune it.I have a very hilly yard and after hefting this I was concerned it wouldn't make it uphill, but it appears to move at the same speed regardless of the terrain.  On high you have to stare hard at the wheel spokes for a bit before you can detect movement.  How this works is water comes from the hose into the rear of the unit, then through the two wands which spin, turning a gear that turns the wheels.  Simple and ingenious.I've only had it jump off the hose once, and thats when I made a real hairpin turn to see if it could make it.  Do note that if it jumps the hose it'll go off in some semi-random arc until it runs out of hose.  So while its tempting to set it and go to bed or leave for the day, you might want to check on it once in a while.This is also very handy for those really dry areas where I want to apply a lot of water to a decent sized spot but I dont want to have to remember to keep moving a sprinkler and to turn it off.  This is a nice time and water saver.For those times when I lose a pipe, its also nice to know I have a week or so to fix it and can get the coverage I need from the Rain Train.  This wont ever replace a full sprinkler system, but it'd be fine for watering a really large area that hasn't been fitted with an irrigation system yet, or as I use it for large spot overwatering and temporary irrigation replacement."

        "text": "It's hard writing a review for this Flexogen garden hose because it has a couple big problems, but something else about it makes up for that one problem. Read on:One thing you have to know- pretty much ANY garden hose you buy will tangle if you don't wrap it the right way. However, some hoses it won't matter if you don't do a good job wrapping it. Unfortunately, others (like this one) are sort of cheap and get knotted easily, so you DO have to take the time to wrap it correctly or else the hose will be damaged over time. I guess if you're not the type of person that wraps the hose when you're done with it (and just leave it sit in the yard) none of this will matter. But in my house we have to wrap the hoses.This means, if you drag the hose across the yard, you might have to go back and straighten out the knots because knots WILL most likely happen. And they will happen in three or four different spots on the hose. To me that's a sign of a bad hose. If one knot occurs that's ok. More than one knot and the hose is bad.However, the one thing that makes up for the knot problem is that I've NEVER had a problem with this hose squirting water where it shouldn't. You see, it's hard for me to say whether this Flexogen hose is bad or good. It has problems, but if you can deal with the knot problem you will have a good hose that will last a long time.I'd say using it just to wash your car isn't a bad idea, but dragging the hose across the yard to rinse off things (and water the garden) IS a bad idea because the knots will continue to occur, so you'll have to keep walking all the way back to where the hose begins to straighten it out.  If you think that's not a problem go ahead and get one."

        "text": "UPDATE:  Originally, I gave this hose 5 stars but after using them (I bought 3) for a while, I've changed my opinion. Yes, the hoses appear to be well made and are lighter weight than my old professional grade rubber hoses, but Flexogens are still heavy. These Flexogen hoses DO kink, and they kink easily. The only way to reduce the kinking is to completely unroll the entire 100 feet of hose from the reel, lay it flat on the grund, and then turn and turn and turn (twist/rotate) it until it lays completely flat -- make sure there are no \"waves\" or loops. I pulled about 50 feet off the hose reel and, holding the end, walked across my yard. I did not stop to twist out the waves and loops that it formed while unrolling. The hose formed 9 kinks! What a pain in the hand, elbow and shoulder to straighten it! This process wastes time.The second problem is after I screw on my hose wand and turn on the water, this hose becomes unwieldy. The hose turns so that my wand is upside down. It requires a LOT of effort to twist the hose and hold it so the wand sprays downward--requires using both hands. Fighting this hose is painful, very tiring and aggravating.When you rewind it onto a hose reel, the hose twists and turns, causing it to again form waves and loops, which become kinks. Again, you have to twist, rotate, etc. to get all the waves/loops out so the hose lays flat and straight on the ground. As you reel it in, you have to stop and repeat the process. My old commercial-grade hose never did anything like this. You can buy the professional/commercial grade hoses (100 ft) at big box stores and clubs for about $25. Don't buy the Flexogen.Due to age and arthritis in my hands, I needed to replace my heavy, rubber commercial-grade garden hoses with lighter weight, easier-to-maneuver hoses. I was barely able to wind the old rubber hoses on the hose reel or drag them around the yard. After reading reviews on Amazon and other places for garden hoses, I chose this hose. I'm glad I did. While it's still heavy, it weighs considerably less than my commercial-grade rubber hose. It's easier to wind on the reel and easier to drag around the yard.The Amazon description calls this a \"lightweight\" hose. It is NOT  light. It's substantial. I found a local store that  had this hose in 25-, 50- and 75-ft lengths. I was able to lift each and compare to heavy duty hoses of the same length. I couldn't feel much of a difference, so I definitely would call this a medium- to heavy-weight hose (but lighter than my rubber one).This hose is easier to handle than my old rubber ones because it's more flexible. (I suspect that my old hoses have stiffened over the years.)I've only used one (I bought 3 of these) for about 1.5 weeks. It's been too hot, too muggy and too rainy to use it much, but I'm pleased so far. I believe this hose is a very good quality and should last many years. The solid brass fittings are thick so they won't get dents that cause leaks. Because I haven't dragged it around the yard yet, I cannot say whether it really is a \"no-kink\" hose. I recommend this hose because o the quality."

Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose. Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company (Gilmour) won't honor the warranty. And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or two.Let me reiterate, Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses. I wrote to them multiple times and was told (without explanation) that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses. If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty, you may not get it.On the Gilmour website, there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced.  On Amazon, it does say \"This heavy-duty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee\". It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package.

I could have bought the replacement parts and changed them out for $30, but then I decided to just get a new one.  There are a couple of changes between the older and the newer model.  The new unit is lighter and seems to have more power, though that may be because of the new brushes working better.  The one BIG change is the guard over the blade.  It is too soon to tell if this is an improvement or just a way to save money on their part.  It certainly is less safe.The older model had a &#34;swing open&#34; cover which protected the blade almost completey above the ground level.  Good part about that was not being able to get fingers or toess into the cutting area.  Bad part was having to stop for built up grass, or when the ground was wet, built up mud.  You'd have to stop and open the door to clean out the area.The newer model doesnot have a cover and most of the blade area is open.  There is something akin to a bicycle fender covering the blade for protection.  The first day I used it, the ground was wet and dirt built up in the shield, but not enough to really bog down the blade.  I unplugged the unit for safety sake, but unlike the older model, you needed a big screwdriver to pull out all the mud.  If you use it on dry ground, the newer model will have less build up of grass than the older one.I am hoping to get at least eight years out of this unit, like I did with my last one."

I had these in spades creeping over my driveway and over onto the concrete rain channel gutter in front of our house.

I just backed up and hit it again and away the edger went, without even breathing hard.  Even the gas-powered edger wasn't this good.The secondary handle and the adjustable edge guide are quite helpful.

Its light weight, easy rolling wheels and great cutting power more than compensate for the 100-ft extension cord it's tethered to.  I think it took me as long to rewind the cord as it took to edge the grass (total edging is about 200-225 linear feet).  Also it has two large wheels in the back and one at the front, so it stays level and makes it easy to push in a straight line.  With the edge guide that rides against the driveway or walkway there was very little of the sparking caused by the blade hitting the concrete.This is about as easy as it gets.  No more gas and oil mix, no more new spark plugs, no more 15-20 pulls to get the engine to start, and it's relatively quiet when running.  Just press the trigger and go.  Love it, love it, love it."

I also use it to keep a trench space between my grass and my landscaped areas, which has worked much better than a trimmer.We had a gas powered edger before this one, but it was too heavy for me.  I actually enjoy yard work, but rarely did it because the tools we had were difficult for me to manage.

I can confirm that it works with the new GrassHog NST2118Black & Decker NST2118 12-Inch 18-Volt Ni-Cd Cordless Electric GrassHog String Trimmer/Edger.The automatic feed spool on GrassHog advances the string without needing to bump on the ground. The benefit of this system is that cutting is easier as it constantly replaces worn out string, the down side that the usage of the string is faster than when done manually.I have tried wounding the string by hand and found it a bit cumbersome and a bit time consuming, so I figured less than $5 per spool is not to bad to save me 5 minutes of time wounding and dealing with jammed string. Each spool contains 30 feet of 0.065 inch diameter round line. It is factory spooled and is wound tighter than when I wound the spool by hand.To replace the spool:1. Remove battery2. Squeeze the tabs on the spool cap to release it3. Pull the empty spool out by pulling directly away from the housing4. Clean out the housing from debris5. Make sure that the level that controls the spooling  is aligned with the edge of the housing6. Take a string from the new spool and feed it through the eyelet in the housing7. Push the spool into the housing and rotate it until it feels seated and the tabs of the spool align with the holes in the housing8. Put the cap back on9. The string outside the housing should be 5 3/8 inches, if it is longer than this length use scissors to trim itCollage of two different views of the spools in this package attached under customer photos.Overall, I am pleased with the spools - they should take me through the next couple of summers!Ali Julia review"

I spent at least as much time rewinding the spool as I did trimming grass.  Then I found the model Black & Decker trimmer that takes disposable spools -- like these.  They're a godsend.  Perhaps it's more economical to wind your own spool, but if your time (and blood pressure) mean anything to you, disposable spools are the way to go.  (And the manufacturer says you CAN hand-wind these spools if you like -- so you won't be stuck if you don't happen to have a fresh disposable spool on hand.)"

I know I am crazy and too kind but I kinda believe in Karma and not hurting anything unless it hurts me so I will just use it for bbq's and times where I am outside, and make sure I have the mosquito attractant.. I know I am crazy, but that is how I feel :)"

One late night, almost midnight, I went out into the side yard with my dog so she could do her business, and saw BATS flying from the woods and zooming by the bug zapper, then back to the trees again.  The bats were picking off the bugs that were attracted by the bug zapper!  How cool is that?!?  I am such a city kid that I made myself a cup of hot cocoa and sat by the back door with the porch light on, just watching the bats go back and forth.  Since that evening, I've seen the bats almost every time I happen to go outside late at night, so I guess my bug zapper is doing well to keep our local bats fat and happy.  (I'm glad to say the bats are in no danger from this zapper due to the grid guard, btw.)I've had this 80 watt model for over 3 months now, and it works beautifully even though it's exposed to the wind, rain, and hail.  Depending on how warm the weather has been, I'll take the leaf blower to it to clean the bug zapper every week or two.  With the leaf blower, the bug zapper swings around wildly, but it doesn't damage this sturdy bug zapper!  All bugs come off easily.I also have this zapper on a light-sensitive timer, so it comes on at dusk, and off again at dawn."

I also bought the shepherds crook that is 48\" tall that was purchased by many others, and IMO it is too short. The instructions state to hang it 6-8' in the air. If this is  true, this crook will be insufficient for optimal bug zapping. Hopefully I'm wrong with this one!I'll update when I receive my replacement unit.UPDATE JULY 20thAmazon got me the replacement device with enough time to spare for the party tonight, which I'm exceptionally happy for. The first bug zapper is back in the box waiting to ship back, and the new one is out waiting for tonight for some bug carnage. When I opened the package (which was NOT damaged) the first thing I notice is the electrified grid is bent and misshapen. I tried to push bend it back, but it looks like it is a factory defect. The bad thing is because of this defect, the safety of the device is decreased - I can tough the electrified grid with my fingers without a problem! I'll see if later I can remove the lightbulb so it'll allow me to correct the metal bending a bit more. I luckily don't have children, however if I did they would have zero problems zapping their fingers.Flowtron is DEFINITELY not scoring big points with this device thus far! We will see how things go tonight.UPDATE AUGUST 1stThe bug zapper has been working out great. I can't tell you the thousands of annoying insects this thing has fried. On a cooler night it went crazy. It was the best serial killer I've ever seen. The Mosquitos have had a severely noticeable decline. Previously I couldn't leave the back door for more than 5 minutes without receiving multiple bites, and now can sit outside for 30 minutes with a rare bite attempt. Huge improvement! The zapping grid is still a bit bent out of shape, but its obviously working, so no complaints!One note: In the directions it states, \"The (product number)15 and (product number)80 are designed with a three pronged (grounded) plug). The (product name)40 is made with a two pronged plug and should be installed with the appropriate plug recepticle. ... NOBODY sells 2-prong extension cords anymore!

That is where its power comes into play and that is where the pruner works very well. Not sure why the difference, but there it is.

Without strain! Then I can use the post-hole digger to lift out the loosened soil, or I can just spade it out into a bucket for use somewhere else. As weak as I am, I can get two 2-foot holes dug before I have to rest.I've been frustrated because I've been too broke to pay someone to come put these trellises in and worried because I know the vines will be here before I know it.

I was looking for something to help turn compost into my vegetable gardens.The criterion I was looking for was something inexpensive that wouldn't break the bank the way a tiller would. But would still get the job done without causing me to be laid up with back pain for a week. For the most part I have been very pleased.We have 2- 12'x12',and  2-8'x8' beds  along with a few smaller freestyle plots, and we mainly use the claw to add compost and cow manure to them every Spring . With the claw I am able to quickly mix in my amendments, and to loosen up the soil about a half foot down in next to no time. If I want to go extra deep, it does take a double dose of clawing , but it is worth it in the end. And it really is not that much extra work since the soil has been pre-loosened a bit by the first go around.As far as starting a bed from scratch, I have used it to start new plots, but only after the sod has been removed. I do think it would be a tough chore to try to do a new bed from start to finish, with only the Claw,and without removing the grass first, but not impossible.When weeding I find it invaluable for use in between rows. It is a breeze to simply stick the claw into the center of a clump of weeds and give a twist and a tug and be done.My one complaint is that the handle has come a tad bit loose. It is still perfectly functional and it took about 5 or more years of good solid use for that to happen, but for someone with a larger plot who uses it more often it may be a concern."

The negatives are more numerous. The handle on this mower has fatigued 6 times in two years. I have ordered replacement handles a couple times after duct taping proved to be a poor fix at best. The grass catcher has been replaced twice because it fell apart. We are on our second sharpening set. The most irritating aspect  of having this mower is that it does a poor job if the grass gets too long between mowings. The weird weather conditions this spring has resulted in my grass seeding twice and growing like crazy. Long strands of germinating grass stand in contrast to the parts that actually do get cut. Most of the time, my husband mows the lawn twice in an attempt to get it even. Usually that makes little difference as to the lawn's overall appearance.This is a cheap mower. It might be great for someone who has a small yard, but my yard isn't small. This mower Isn't even close to my grandpa's old push mower that really tamed an unruly lawn and was solid.  Last night I had to order a new handle and another sharpening kit.Today I am going to buy a nice power driven Toro and I'll mow the lawn from now on."

        "text": "Everyone I know advised me against getting a reel mower.  I was cautioned that they don't cut well and they're hard to push.  But I didn't consider a gas mower an option (too expensive, noisy, hard to maintain, and dangerous), a corded electric would be too cumbersome, and a rechargeable would be impractical because there is not a convenient place for me to charge it.  So I took the plunge and bought this one.I'm completely intimidated by all things mechanical, so I was worried about assembling this mower, but it really is easy.  The only thing you have to do is screw the five sections of the handle together, then clip it onto the mower body.  The instructions were adequate (3.5 stars there), even for an assembly-phobe like me.  The current configuration does not require any tools for assembly, but there was an add-on bag of washers and nuts included with my mower that are recommended for a more securely assembled handle.  If you opt to use the new nuts instead of the original wingnuts, you'll need a wrench.After just fifteen minutes or so, I was up and running.  To my delight, the mower pushes easily, even through long grass.  And it's very entertaining to watch the grass being rapidly snipped off.  I felt like Edward Scissorhands.  Who would have thought mowing grass would be so fun?  I was a little tired and winded when I finished (in a good way), but I had been practically running with this thing because I enjoyed it so much.  I kept looking for stray patches to go over again, but, alas, the mower did such a good job, when I was finished, my yard looked like a golf course.A few facts about me and my lawn to see if my wholehearted recommendation will apply to you:  I'm female, plus-sized, totally out of shape, and usually quite sedentary (one reason I thought this would be a good idea).  I had never mowed grass before in my life (didn't have a yard before last summer, and then I accepted the fine services of a neighborhood girl with a ride-on mower who worked cheap).  My yard is about 6500 square feet, level, fairly flat, and covered with long pine needles all over the place (the mower didn't even notice them).Some older reviews address a couple of problems that are no longer an issue:  Scotts now (late April 2007) packages the mower with the cushioned handgrip already on, and the apparently easily loosened wingnuts (as already mentioned) can now be replaced with regular nuts (not mentioned in the current manual, but included in the box with a note).  Scotts should have included shorter bolts with the new nuts (since you now don't need the extra length the wingnuts required), but this is a trivial point.  Put your wingnuts on after the new nuts for a more \"finished\" appearance.A reel mower might not be suitable for everyone and every yard, but for me, it's fantastic.  It's quiet, easy to maneuver, non-intimidating, good exercise, fun, environmentally sound, and inexpensive.  I couldn't be happier with this mower.UPDATE 1-17-13I used my mower for the whole season and never had any problems with it.  The next year, health issues forced me to again use the services of the neighborhood girl to mow my lawn.  Then I got married, and my husband wanted nothing to do with a reel mower (though he admitted that it was cool, he'd always used a gas mower, and that's what he wanted to stick with, though I HATE the noise and smell when he mows).  So my Scotts sat in storage for years, and last fall Hubby finally convinced me to let it go.  I sold it for $50 to a single mom with a tween daughter who was going to mow their small lawn.  I let them try it out on our grass, and they were both immediately thrilled and couldn't wait to get home to use it.  I felt like I was kind of passing on a torch.  There's something wonderfully enabling about this mower.  If I found myself again being the person responsible for mowing a small-to-medium-size lawn, I would definitely buy another one of these."

That second set of wheels replace a roller all right and the clever height adjustment let's you know that someone gave some thought to this device.  One of the one-star complaints regarding this mower involves the difficulty pushing it.  Well, you can alleviate that by simply adjusting the closeness of the blade  or even the angle of the cut; mine was initially a real bear because the blade was factory adjusted to such a closeness that the reel blades added enormously to the drag, far more than the grass did.  Once you've tapped in an adjustment to the closeness of the blade to its stropping plate (remember just 1/4 turn at the most and oil all the blades) it'll be close to effortless.  The main thing, however, is that reel mowers do such a pretty cut."

        "text": "I have had many people look at and watch me as I mowed our lawn for the first time with this reel mower and all I could think is that these people think I'm going green... well I'm not. I have always lived a conservative life, recycled (still do), and so on. And not because some celebrity told me I should or whatever, but because it just makes sense to do so. So with that out of the way, onto the actual product.When gas prices peaked last summer we stopped using our lawn tractor because it used just too much gas (and it didn't cut the grass all that well to begin with) and just used our self propelled Honda mower. Well after the tractor sat all summer we decided to just sell it and buy a reel mower and so far it has more then paid for itself.The first question EVERYONE asks is, is it hard to push? Plain and simple, NO. These new reel mowers are lighter and are better designed so they are much easier to push then the old Leave It To Beaver style reel mowers. Also the rear stabilizer wheels also makes it easier to handle.The second question that is asked is, how well does it cut the grass. Well that depends on how tall the grass is, how wet it is, etc.. A reel mower cuts with a sheering action (like scissors) instead of a tearing action that is associated with a rotary mower. This leaves your grass in a much healthier state then the tearing action does. Now I will say that it is harder to cut tall grass and we have to mow more often, but that's the nature of the beast.After mowing the lawn for a few weeks with the Scotts 20 inch reel mower I can actually tell a difference in the grass, much better and healthier looking.The only gripe I have is the handle is a bit flimsy and wobbles a lot... kind of a pain when you execute a turn. We'll probably end up welding it together so it doesn't wobble.All said and done it's a bit more work then using our self propelled Honda, but produces a much better looking lawn.Pros:Fairly cheap upfront cost.Little to no upkeep.Leaves your lawn looking awesome.At least ten times quieter then pretty much any rotary mower, thus allows your to keep your windows open when you are mowing.No fumes (darnit I love the smell of gas!).20\" mower path.Cons:Made in China...Some plastic pieces, not sure how they are going to last but we'll see.Wobbly handle."

        "text": "I really like this mower a lot.  I have owned a Brill and Sunlawn, but I like the Scotts classic better than either.  I do have a 40 year old Scotts Deluxe that is substantially heavier and which I like the best of all.  I use the old Scotts Deluxe for mowing my own yard and leave the Scotts classic in my trunk to mow rentals.  Here are my pros and cons.Pros.1. Heavier than others.  That makes it less likely to slip when going over uneven lawn or wet grass. It also has more reel momentum making it cut tall floppy grass and leaves better.2. Handle comes off easily.  There are little clips that hold the handle in, but I do not use them. I just pop the handle on and off, making it easy to store in my trunk and use any time.3.  No gas, much, much lighter and smaller than a gas mower. Of course this is true of all reel mowers, but it is an important point for me.  I can leave this in my trunk and not worry about gas fumes or about refilling gas.  It is always ready to go.  With the handle off, it does not take up too much of my trunk and it is light enough to easily take in and out of my trunk.4. Durable.  You might not think of this with a reel mower, but it saves me nice money in maintenance.  I actually mow several rental lawns weekly.  With that much mowing I have to take my mower in for maintenance every year.  Also I have bent the crankshaft on multiple mowers.  The only maintenance on this is sharpening the blade.5.  Easy to sharpen the blade.  This mower is made by American Lawn Mower, which means it can use the very easy, very cheap american lawn mower sharpening kit available from amazon and tons of other places for under $20.  I like the kit and feel I get a better cut with this mower than I did with the brill or sunlawn models.6. Quiet. Maybe it is a little louder than the brill, but it is still super quiet.  If I feel like mowing in the middle of the night, just because I can, I do and it bothers noone.  Now when I use a gas mower, the noise really bothers me.Cons.1. Handle is super flexy.  They really cheaped out on the handle. The sunlawn and brill models are much stronger.  It works and lasted a heavy use season, but it will not last as long as the body.2. Tough time with weeds. Like all reel mowers, this thing does not like to mow anything that is tall and floppy. This one handles weeds and tall grass much better than average, but you should still try to hold down the weeds and cut weekly if possible. That being said my sister often forgets to mow her weedy lawn for a few weeks, and I am able to mow it with my Scotts classic when her sunlawn would have more difficulty."

With a gas mower you could tilt the back end up and over some small obstacles. That wasn't the biggest problem. A little extra weed whipping to be done. The biggest problem is the quality of the cut. If your grass is not perfect plush growth like a golf course the cut will be OK not great. This mower is for people who LOVE grass. Not for people who HATE gas powered tools because you have to mow almost every other day. I hate mowing and grass. I mow mine down to the ground every time and hope it doesn't rain so I wont have to do it again for 2-4 weeks. Some people coddle their grass. They think of it as a family member. They talk about their grass non-stop. They can have a discussion about bagging over mulching for over an hour. They have chemicals for weed control, ants, grubs, PH balance, feed. They seed and water regularly. They spend several hundred dollars every year on their lawns. Their passion for their grass is second only to their family. If this sounds like you, great! It's great to have a passion and this mower is for you. If you mow your lawn down to the dirt and curse at gas powered tools and HATE mowing. This mower is not for you."

        "text": "I wish I could say that I purchased this mower after seeing Al Gores \"inconvenient truth\" and my life was changed by it.  The truth however is that I finally got fed up with my old power mower failing to start for the ump-teenth time after repeated repairs and promises of it now \"running like a champ\".  This old time mower will take some getting used too, and also don't kid yourself, it doesn't do the job as easily as a power mower by any means.  However on the plus side you will never again suffer through a mower that fails you, needs fuel, requires any real maintenance like oil changes or plugs, and best of all if you take care of it, will be the very last mower you ever buy.  The only way this mower will up and quit is if you do.  Any maintenance it does require is easily handled by a screwdriver or wrench.  Even for those whose knowledge of small gas engines doesn't go much beyond kicking it and swearing when it disappoints you. I fully agree with the reviewer here who stated it is best used on pristine lawns with lush healthy grass. (Unfortunately a lot of people that have lawns of such quality often don't cut their own lawns. If you happen to be the exception, read on) This mower cuts thick grass of reasonable length straight and evenly very easily.  Where it fails you is on long loose weeds fluttering in the wind.  The mower passes right over them no matter how many times you try again and again to sever it.  I solved that problem by putting a little more effort into trimming with the weed whacker, and leaving the heavy grass to the mower.  And it by far is most efficient when used regularly once or twice a week.  A time table you will find effortlessly fits most peoples lifestyle since the mower is so light and easy to use that mowing the lawn will no longer be an all day Saturday event.  Unlike lawns where power mowers are used that usually get long and seedy looking in between jobs, you will find yourself taking this mower out far more often just to hit the \"high spots\".  Thus your lawn comes to have the appearance of a man that gets his hair cut every three weeks and thus never looks like he is long overdue.  You can also get away with using this mower early in the morning or late in the evening since it makes very little racket. And one last thing, I didn't notice much difference in the physical effort needed to push it considering that most people use walk behind push mowers in any event.  Aside from having to use it a little more often, and its lack of cutting power on long weeds, I consider this mower to be well worth one's investment.  You will eventually come to find your lawn never looked better."

The second time I used it, the grass had gotten a little high, so there was a lot of back and forth action. It took forever, really. I know that this product isn't meant for that, but that was my situation. Anyway, as I was finishing the handle came apart. There are four wingnuts and bolts holding the assembly together, and one on each side had apparently worked their way off while I was mowing without me noticing. The third one came off as I was putting it away and the handle came apart.Yeah, I was putting a lot of stress on it compared to a regular mowing, but that should not have happened. I followed the assembly instructions to the letter. It was really a very simple assembly. I didn't miss any steps or try to do it without reading the instructions, though. I was very disappointed with this product.If you have a flat yard and are going to be able to keep it mowed short without ever letting it get out of hand AT ALL (like leaving town for a couple weeks), this mower may be for you.If you have a sloped, lumpy yard, do not buy this product. Just don't. It is so hard to use. I honestly think I would like it if I had a nice, flat yard, but as it is this thing was worthless to me."

I wish all I had to do was put in two screws and be done but there were 5 big pieces to the handle and lots of little pieces (fortunately almost all the same set of pieces). I could put it together with only a little difficulty and I don't have much practice at putting things together. I couldn't get the E-rings in. My husband managed that.The handle flexes. I wondered if that was needed to handle the bumps, but after using it I don't think it is. I think it is just cheap. The mower part feels more substantial.  It is made in China. I wonder how many years of not using my gas mower it will take to make up for transporting this from China.In the reviews people talked about it stopping suddenly. I had the same issue. I have a very small yard; it is level except for a few odd little depressions. At those spots as well as at random moments the mower would freeze up. It happened some times when the clippings kind of got clogged on the back guard. Other times, I could not see why it stopped. It went right over the small sticks in my yard, which I was happy about. On the other hand, all the dandelions just bent over and snapped right back up after I passed over them. I had a few spots where I went at the grass from a few directions before it mowed. Once I got it going it tended to keep going, but every corner meant a full stop and then had to try to get `er rolling again. Next time, I'll see if I can figure out a way to mow with less full corners. As I said it is a small yard, so I'm not sure it will work.Overall I am happy with the product except for the issues I mentioned above. I didn't want to spend too much, so for the price this is about what I expected. I plan to use this every other time I mow. I'm keeping the gas mower to get through the weeds and plants that are out of control. As I'm growing more native plants and food, my area of grass is decreasing."

If you are looking for a perfectly even lawn this may not be for you, but I don't mind an occasional weed sticking up here or there.  The higher height setting seems to allow the mower to go over most small twigs, which was another concern of mine.  I mow each &#34;section&#34; of my lawn once per week, so the grass does not get too high.  Also I switch mowing directions each time.  If you are not able to keep up with your lawn this probably isn't for you as it does best when cutting about 1/3 of the length of the grass.

I can mow at 7 in the morning, or 9 at night without bothering the neighbors, too.The Scott has a number of good things going for it: It's light, easy to push, fairly easy to adjust, and you can sharpen it yourself with a simple kit. That alone will save a bit of money. It's my favorite unit in its price class. (My favorite mower is the Brill, from Germany, which is even lighter and easier to push  than the Scott and doesn't require sharpening for 8 years, but which Amazon doesn't carry... yet.)If you do buy the Scott, get the sharpening kit, as when you do need it you'll want to have it on hand.

It's easy to adjust the height of the cut, as well.I'll just note one small problem that I've had and two limitations of all mowers of this type.  There is a thin foam pad on the top of the handle.  On mine, it split on the left side the first time that I used the mower, which isn't a big deal.  Mr. Shenker in his excellent review reports that his mower will cut long grass.  Mine leaves long grass uncut.  I believe that this is simply a limitation of reel mowers in general.  Also, it's probably more important to make sure that the ground is dry with any mower that you power yourself, simply because you need traction on the ground to make the blades turn, and this, in turn, makes it more likely that you'll skid on any mud.  With those limitations, however, I can unhesitatingly recommend this mower."

The downside to any push mower is that apparently they require a special skill set to sharpen the blades & most garden shops do not sharpen the blades.  I was able to find one place that sharpens blades in the entire area and it is not cheap. It's not a good idea to do it yourself, quite dangerous, & dull blades are useless. The blades seemed to dull very quickly, if that is possible - maybe they weren't very sharp to begin with. I hope more people will buy push mowers, which will force more shops to consider getting the tools so they can offer sharpening. I have 4 friends who all have the same problem.

It's much, much cheaper to start flowers from seed on your own versus buying them at the local Home Depot or nursery. I already ordered more impatiens and I have some vincas I want to get started for the warmer months. Buy some decent potting mix or seed starting mix, or if you're really crunchy granola run some garden soil through your oven @ about 350 degrees for an hour to sterilize it. I like to add some perlite to soil mixes. I also like to water the soil BEFORE THE SEEDS ARE SOWN with Miracle Gro. The transparent dome will maintain humidity while the seeds are sprouting. I'd use a decent plant mister (Couldn't insert product link, URL is http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0010H748S/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_details) to keep the seedlings content.Great product. I really wish I'd ordered two or three of them."

But I was wrong! My granddaughter and I did the first tray together. She poured the water, then I counted out the seeds for her to plant. Her Mom and I did the second tray after she got bored. Within three days the first of the plants were up. It has now been 8 days and nearly every pellet has seedlings. I have already had to move the first ones (cantaloupe) to a large peat pot since they are five inches tall! I am using one of the top covers under the four large peat pots.Almost all of the others are 2 inches tall, but still fragile.This will be my first garden grown completely from seed, and I will definitely use this again next year!Edited, All of the plants are in the ground and doing well!

The peat pots only expanded to just under an inch.An aluminum pan with a clear lid would work just as well, as the metal would distribute the heat better.  I found the lid popped off easily so I check on it several times a day.  I have beans and turnips growing in my peat pots.With care I intend to reuse the pan and lid for multiple uses.  For new gardeners this is an effective way to grow seeds.  I could also place peat pots in sealed plastic bags for cheaper, though. I will report back in a week when the first seeds sprout."

        "text": "I've used this and a few other similar Jiffy products the last several years to start seeds for my garden. They are very easy to use (add hot water per the directions to expand the included pellets, then plant seeds per packet instructions) and less messy than using seed starting mix in flats--and perhaps even easier as well, though probably a bit more expensive. A clear plastic cover/dome is included to help germination. When the seedlings are ready to pot up or transplant, the netting tears off very easily and allows for transplanting with minimal root disturbance. Some people also leave the netting on and I seem to remember reading that it's supposed to disintegrate, but that hasn't been my experience. You do have to be careful with larger-rooted plants (squash, etc.) that you take care of them before their roots start to grow through the netting, otherwise you'll probably shock them more if/when you remove it. Finally, I like the square shape of this tray because it allows me to evenly rotate the plants under my grow lights.However, there are a few things you should know that don't seem to be made clear. Jiffy sells refill pellets so you can use the tray again, ideally saving money--but they have several similar-looking products that take different-sized pellets, so you need to know which ones you need. This 25-cell tray takes 42mm pellets (not 30, 36, or 50mm, which they also sell). Jiffy sells the 25-pack ofJiffy 5777 Refills, which are the right size. They used to be almost as expensive on Amazon as this complete kit, but as of my writing they are now an add-on item for about half the cost. Beware of third-party sellers; for example, I see a 200-pack of supposedly 42mm pellets,Jiffy 7 Peat Soil 42mm Pellets, but they were actually the wrong size, so I had to return them. You may also be able to find them locally. Just be sure you get the right size, which is the 42mm size, sold under the \"Jiffy 5777\" name. Jiffy does not make sizing clear on either the original product or the refill, both of which would be a great help.Finally, I will note that because of the availability of refills, I was hoping to save money by re-using the tray for a few years and just replacing the pellets. However, after saving two trays from last season (both inside under good, climate-controlled conditions), one became slightly warped and curled up towards the outside, making it undesirable for use since I'm not sure if my plants would fall over with this slight curl of the tray. It also developed a small crack in the bottom, which is important to be aware of if you're using (and watering) these inside as I assume most people do. Obviously, these are just thin plastic and not something I'd expect to keep for years and years, but I was hoping to at least get a couple years' use out them. This works better sometimes than others.In summary, I've used this product for a couple years now, and it's definitely become my favorite method for most plants. I plan to continue to use this product for as long as it's available--just be warned about refill sizes, and perhaps be careful about how the tray is stored if you're hoping to re-use it for the next season."

I also places a motion activated camera so I could better see how they were or were not being trapped by the device.Within one 24 hour period, three out of four traps placed were tripped with nothing at all inside.  Upon video and still image review, a Deer Mouse had trotted over the top of the three traps that were tripped and of course activated them without being inside.The third trap remained unsprung, but the Deer Mouse only sniffed the opening and failed to enter.With all four traps re-set for another go, the Deer Mouse now just scampers around each trap and doesn't bother with them at all.I have added a photo of the setup and mouse to the collection of photos submitted by buyers/reviewers.I like the idea of the tilt trap and in theory it's great, in practical use it's simply not effective.  There are many solutions to this problem:The most popular is to simply put a cardboard box over the tilted UP end, through a hole that is cut just slightly taller than the trap at the fulcrum.  This allows the trap to activate, but does not allow the mouse to stand ON the tipped up section.  As this is an innovation which isn't already a part of the trap, I am giving my two star rating on the traps as designed.It also wouldn't hurt to make them larger with an adjustable balance weight... the buyer can of course make any number of modifications and the system is already being copied and improved by other companies... I guess this is an example of another weak patent registration process.So, I sadly would not recommend these to friends and others wanting to rid themselves of mice quickly.... but IF you enjoy the process of problem solving and using these as a starting point, you will certainly foil the mice and end up collecting them in short order.Look for the design which has a housing over the tipped up portion... it's better."

A traditional mouse trap would be more humane if one couldn't release the catch within minutes of a trap.  I never did catch a mouse with it; I grew tired of checking the thing too often...I wish the trap were just a little bit bigger... but as it is, it is too small for a mouse to live for more than a few minutes."

If a photo of the back of the package were also included in this listing, you could zoom in and verify which models of the brands listed on the front view it will actually fit (Well Duh!!).  Additionally, while listings for some other Oregon chains advise we use the selector guide found at Oregonchain.com, most do not!  Oregon makes an excellent saw chain. Each and every listing should prominently provide explicit instruction that potential buyers need to first verify the correct selection for their particular make & model, before ordering.  Do they look at all those questions customers post (will this fit my xxx model of my xxx brand)?My father's Remington 16-inch electric, Model 1630A actually requires the S58, even though entering that make and model into Amazon's Search field brought us directly to this listing.  Unfortunately, we only discovered the mismatch when our shipment arrived and we found that it was not listed on the back of the carton containing the chain.  A visit to the Oregon website (also suggested on the carton but nowhere in this listing) revealed that the S58 is the correct choice.....even though the description and photo of the S58 at Amazon states \"Fits Echo, John Deere and Sears Chain Saws\" with no reference to Remington!!! The Amazon listing for S58 contained an advisory to first check the selector guide at Oregon.  That advisory is not included on this listing!  So, it did not do me much good to shop on Amazon versus visiting the local \"big box store\" when their listing resulted in the shipment & my return of the wrong product!  Are you going to reimburse my time/$$ to return 3 chains?  Come on guys!  Do you really monitor the responses to your \"Did we miss anything?\" links?UPDATE  (12.7.2013): Well!  I have already heard back on my return (it really pays to use the \"return function\" that can be found under your \"orders history\")and have received a complete refund!!  The email reply also promised this issue would be forwarded through channels.  Hopefully, this will result in a hyperlink being inserted below, with an advisory to first verify exactly which chain fits your saw make and model.  BIG TIP NOT EMPHASIZED ENOUGH EVEN AT THE SELECTOR SITE:  \"count the number of drive links in the chain you have now, and write that number down someplace where you can find it\".  S56 chain has 56 drive links while S58 (and our Remington's old chain)has 58!!I my case, the selector guide gave 4 different alternatives of 58 drive link chains for the electric saw we use behind the garage to cut up wood for splitting.  Since I have years of seasonal experience, and use a large, gas-powered, chain saw with an aggressive style of Oregon chain to fell and section trees in the woods, we chose the aggressive style chain (WARNING: this = \"far greater chance for kick-back and IS NOT for the unwary user\") which was also available at Amazon.com (not the S58 but the 91VXL058G).Lastly, this disappointment is one of the very few I have experienced in my many years and many $$ spent as a customer of Amazon. I use Oregon chains on my big Stihl saw, and have found that they cut a long time before dulling, and can be filed or re-sharpened many times over.  Recommend them highly.PS to the guy with the Poulan Pro...OMG!!!  For kicks and giggles, I looked up your saw on the selector guide.  There were some 15 or more choices and some were 56 link and others 58 link.  Yours is the best example I can see, where knowing to count drive links on the current chain is soooooooo important."

In August, we will empty one of these in a day, so we have to have multiple feeders to keep up.  This is the feeder we have always bought and they are pretty durable but once in a while a black bear will wear one out for us-so we keep a couple extra.  The feeder hangs on a piece of electrical wire that goes under the lid on top and the other end gets bent into a loop to hang on the hook.  But now they have decided to shorten the wire until it is just a few inches long after making the loop and tying the knot under the lid. I know the company must have saved about a penny on the wire length but it doesn't work for us now - I have to use a 2-step ladder to hang it.  So, I'm off to the home store to try to find some red electrical wire that I can use to replace the one that is way too short.Beyond that, this is the feeder to use.  The glass jar cleans easily with a jar brush and the yellow flowers at the bottom pop out so you can reach in with an old toothbrush to clean the inside. The 6 positions works way better than the 4 place feeders for us due to the number of hummingbirds that are trying to feed simultaneously.

        "text": "I've gone through so many hummingbird feeders that the hummingbirds have stopped being cautious when a new one appears.  I've tried decorative blown-glass ones, lightweight plastics ones, and glass/plastic combo ones manufactured by various companies, including Garden Treasures and this one, Perky Pets.  I've tried models with built-in ant moats and others with bee guards.  If I could keep away ants, then I couldn't dissuade the bees.  And ultimately, each model either leaked or crashed to the ground due to the included but inadequate hanging methods.  Finally, however, I think I've found The One, although I combine it with theNectar Protectorto keep ants away -- more on that later.First the details:  the 30-ounce glass bottle holds a lot of nectar, far more than my single family of hummingbirds (now four in all) can consume in a week, the maximum amount of time you should leave a batch of nectar outside.  Its size, however, gives it some heft and a wider opening in the jar to aid in cleaning.  The single-piece plastic base has six, yellow-flowered ports that are too small for bees to enter and a perch that circles it.  It comes with a short piece of red-plastic wire for hanging.  It does not have a built-in ant moat or anything else to dissuade those pests.The base will not leak, as many other models do, because it is constructed of a single piece of molded plastic.  The disadvantage of that is, of course, that you cannot get inside of it to clean.  I've found that if I change the nectar twice a week -- or even, in rare cases, only once -- and rinse out the feeder thoroughly before refilling, the inside remains clean and mold-free.  I also have a set ofDroll Yankees PLB Perfect Little Brushesto clean out the ports.  Like many hummingbird feeders, this one only addresses one pest problem, bees, so you'll probably want to get a separate ant-guard.  Because this feeder hangs with a wire, which I twist several times around itself to keep it from undoing, I have to attach it more or less permanently to the ant-moat above it, making it necessary to remove both, as a single unit, when refilling.  Also, when you tip it upside down to unscrew/empty it, you'll get sugar water on your hands and on the ground, so do it in a location where it doesn't matter.  To continue keeping bees away, make sure you also rinse the outside since the dried sugar will attract them.I do not use colored nectar and instead make my own clear version (4 parts water, boiled, to 1 part sugar).  There is enough red on the feeder to attract the hummingbirds without using colored nectar.I'm giving this feeder five stars because it's the best I've encountered after eight or so attempts.  It's not perfect, but it's darn close.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"

This year they have their eyes and tastes set on the two Perky-Pets in the back yard and not so much on the front yard's other two feeders.  The key to this year's success for them and us is changing the solution every two or three days and putting fill the glass to about 1/4th full.  I am here to simply order two more.  I hope you enjoy yours as much as we enjoy ours.April 29, 2012:  They're back and still as beautiful as ever.  This year so far only two have shown up and I cannot determine their sex or anything.  They are still skittish and will not come to me as in the past.  It takes time.  They use these Perky-Pet 209s almost exclusively even though there are 2 other brands up.November 18, 2011:  Just a quick update.  The feeders are down, the hummers are on their way to Mexico and all is well.  After a full season of use and feeding a whole bunch of hummers I am happy to say these are the best of the best.  I usually changed the feeders every two to three days and have yet to have the first second of any problem except on some mornings the hummers would be a tad impatient with my schedule.  No leaks.  No broken roosts.  Nothing negative.  My homemade ant trap/chaser kept the glass clean on the inside.  I heard that a hand full of dried beans dropped in the glass and a few vigorous shakes would help keep the insides clean and it worked well.  Can't wait for springtime and their arrival.In recent years we have bought several feeders and this is the best yet.  We have had 4 to 5 feeding stations set up and the first one to empty is this and its twin even though one is out front and the others are in the back.  With all factors the same, i.e., sugar water in a glass container this one just has more appeal and frankly I do not know why.  They will not tell me.  When it is empty they do let me know while I on the way to refill it that it sure took me long enough to get there.  I always alternate feeders and will set the empty on top of the trash can while installing the new batch of food.  When I put this one on the can they go to it even though the Brand X has food.  When I set the one with Brand X on the can they could not care less.  Right now our population has grown to about 6 but there is no way to be sure with all them mostly the same colors except the male ruby throated ones.  The like the perch better than the rest and even though the holes are the same as the others they just seem to enjoy sitting there taking a sip.  If simple, hour wasting watching appeals to anyone buy a feeder and check out several of the hummingbird websites for recipes and care.  We use 1 cup sugar to 4 cups boiled water cooled to room temperature.  The hummers are absolutely delightful and thank you Perky-Pet for the 209s."

The bottle is large but the plastic bottom holds a lot of fluid as well.  It is over-sized for our needs, so I just fill it with less food.  Perky Pet should consider creating a new model based on this design but smaller.If I had a complaint, it would be with the wire for hanging the feeder.  A great solution for me was using a wire coat hanger and with pliers, fashioned a loop at one end and making a square shape after passing the wire through the hole in the feeder top. It works great, the wire is the perfect diameter for the hole in the feeder and very strong for windy days!I should mention the packaging is poorly done but it wasn't a problem for me. I can imagine a case of these in a store sitting on a shelf, with customers reaching for a box could easily result in a few being broken, as the glass bottle can easily come out of the box.The price is excellent, highly recommended.Update 7-7-2010, Just bought my 3rd..."

        "text": "I bought 2 different feeders at the same time and this one is holding up much much better. It is solid and easy to clean. I didn't use the wire that came with the feeder as it was too short. But I threaded a pipe cleaner through the top hole and it works great. The hummers love the feeder and I can see it lasting for many years to come.EDITING: I am going to have to lower my rating on this. The hummingbird feeder works fine. The issue is the yellow \"bee guards.\" Did you know that bees and wasps are attracted to the color yellow? So if these \"bee guards\" (dumb name...should be called bee attractors) were any color other than yellow...like RED...then I wouldn't have a nectar feeder in my yard right that I can't even get to because it has so many wasps and yellow jackets on it.one more issue. I woke up one morning to find all six yellow bee guards removed. We searched the grass below and found 3 of them. There were no gnaw marks, chew marks, bites or scratches anywhere on the nectar feeder or yellow plastic flowers. What removed them? I don't know. But now that they are gone, the wasps are actually able to crawl INSIDE the darn nectar reservoir. Like I said, this nectar feeder is all but useless and the moment I can actually remove it without getting attacked by flying insects, I will and never put it back up again."

It's a simple design, has six feeding stations, has a shatterproof glass cylinder and holds a whopping 30 ounces!  I've never had a problem with ants climbing down the wire to the feeder (wires are better than string and hold up better in the wind).  Depending on how hungry your many hummingbirds are, the more you'll have to refill the syrup.  Perky-Pets 'high energy nectar' is good stuff, but seriously, a high concentration of sugar and red coloring does the trick.  Hummingbirds are attracted to the color red.To enhance your hummingbird traffic, supplement it with plants that look great.  The following are some of my favorites for various reasons:Butterfly Bush - comes in blue, ruby, pink and purple and attracts butterflies and hummingbirds.Bottlebrush - small evergreen tree or shrub.  Attracts hummingbirds, but can be messy with its flowers.Fuchsia - comes in bright red or purplish color and is great to hang next to your feeder and attracts hummingbirds.Morning Glory (vine) - multi-color attracts hummingbirds and grows quickly.Flowering red Currant - colorful background shrub that attracts hummingbirds, as well.Note that all these plants grow well in California, so check your local nursery for other suggestions."

Even though bees are a pain and create a problem for some hummingbirds these guards manage to keep the bees at bay.  Our hummers just look at the bees gathered around the guards and laugh at them while eating the nectar.  Typical of most predators the bees attempt to chase the birds but success falls to the birds.One minor problem with the guards is that some insects are small enough to enter the mesh but too stupid to figure a way out and thusly meet their demise.

My brush has the front brass bristles worn down and full of grill gunk but 2/3rds of the bristles in the back look brand new. If the head of the brush was at an angle to the handle this brush would be way better.That said, it's still a good brush.Be careful though as it seems Amazon is combining the reviews between the version of this brush that has brass bristles with the version with steel bristles."

After doing quite a bit of research and reading reviews, I decided to go with this Smokey Joe Silver.  It is absolutely unbeatable, and I would have paid double for it without blinking an eye!  While it doesn't have an adjustable-height grilling surface, it's quite easy to properly place the charcoal in such a way that you get exactly the heat you're looking for.  I've been able to sear fish, or slow-cook buffalo wings, just by estimating the charcoal amount and placement.  I should also note that I usually use the lump type charcoal, not briquettes, and both work equally well in this grill.  Cleaning is a breeze, and so far after using it 12+ times since I got it a couple weeks ago, hasn't even come close to needing it.As far as build quality goes, I really like the solid feel of the grill overall, but the legs could stand to be a bit sturdier.  They aren't as weak as some reviewers have said, but it certainly is the weakest point of the grill as a whole.  The plastic handle has never gotten too hot to handle, not as some reviewers said.  The diameter of the grill could stand to be about 1/4\" larger, to keep it from wiggling around so much when you're brushing it.  The vents constructions seems fantasic, they are easy to open and close, yet stay put when you need them to.  Having easy access to both top and bottom vents allows for lots of experimentation with cooking temperatures.  I love this grill to death, and I point out that fact to my fiance every time i use it (\"see, i told you this thing is friggin' awesome!\").  Even when I buy myself a much larger charcoal grill in the near future, I will still use this grill every time I'm only cooking for 1 or 2 people."

        "text": "The Weber Smokey Joe is a great portable grill as far as cooking quality is concerned but there are a few issues.First the good. You get a decent size grill area for an ultra-portable grill. It measures at 14 1/2 inches in diameter. Sure you probably can't do much with this grill if you are cooking indirect, but that's not what this grill is meant for. The grill cooks much like it's larger cousin - the Weber One-Touch. The porcelain enamel coating helps prevent rust. There's a vent damper on the bottom of the grill (as well as the top) so it's quite easy to control your temperature, much better then any other portable grill I've owned anyways. The ash-catcher works well enough to keep hot pieces of ember from falling to the ground.As I mentioned before, there are a few caveats. My main complaint is that this grill has no lid-lock. This makes transportation a bit cumbersome, especially for a grill that is meant to be portable. You have to buy the Gold or Platinum version to get this functionality. I believe all portable grills should be easy to transport. I use a couple bungee cords to lock my lid down during transportation. Another small issue I had with mine is that one of the legs is a bit shorter then the other two, so my grill doesn't sit as evenly as it should. This isn't a big deal because Weber has great customer service, it's not that big of a deal anyways, it's just a little off. Finally the top grate doesn't fit very tightly so it wobbles around a bit - again a small issue. One other thing I should mention is that even though it has an ash catcher, it doesn't have any sort of One-Touch type of system, so you have to dump it to clean it (the vent damper doesn't quite do it).  This isn't an issue at all for me because it's very light and easy to clean anyways but I thought I would mention that for those that might be curious.All in all this is a great portable grill. For my wife and I this is a great grill to use even when we aren't going anywhere because it needs so little charcoal. Cooking on this grill definitely feels like I'm grilling on a baby version of my One-Touch. There are a few issues that keep this grill from getting a perfect score, but don't let these small issues keep you from buying this great grill. Personally I believe it's worth the $5.00 to go ahead and upgrade to the Gold so you can have the lid-lock, but it's not essential, like I said before a couple bungee cords do the trick if you need that functionality. Happy grilling!"

Thank goodness we have Amazon Prime, because I didn't think to order a grill until a few days before the storm; it arrived on Friday.  We lost power early Sunday morning and did not get it back until this Saturday.  There are only three of us, so this was just the right size for us -- you can fit three to four burgers on the grill at a time.  It was simple to put together and very easy to use -- just roll 4 or 5 sheets of newspaper loosely, place them in the bottom of the kettle, put in about 30 briquets in a pyramid shape, light the papers and the charcoal is ready to use in about 20 minutes.  Spread the charcoal out evenly  and place the grill in place and you are ready to go.  There's an instruction booklet included.  It was really a lifesaver this week and will be used regularly from now on.  It's easily portable for camping trips, too."

        "text": "Am writing this while cooking some chicken on a WSJ i found last week in new condition for a Hamilton. Let me preface my comments by stating that I have a 22-inch Weber with hinged grate that I love.The WSJ is small, somewhat solidly constructed (mine, while unused, has rust rings around the handle welds that go through the cover - not good).However, most folks use this Weber as a portable grill. Weber, for gawd's sakes, incorporate some form of simple mechanism ON ALL MODELS to keep the lid on in order to use the carry handle! (i use a pair of bungees looped every 45 degrees).The stove's best feature, the ability to cook using fewer coals, is also its drawback. This stove is best suited for slow cooking, delicate kebabs, fish, hot dogs, and burgers - not for hot, quick searing and grilling of thick steaks.Other drawbacks are the vents, which do not (at least on my unit) rotate smoothly. And trying to adjust the bottom vent to control air flow will result in your burning the beegeebees out of your fingers - i suggest fireproof mitts handling this stove.Also, being lightweight, this stove can dramatically shift during your cooking session, resulting in the potential for spillage of hot coals - especially if used on a light platform to increase cooking height (cooking on the ground with this thing can be down, but for many folks, may be uncomfortable). I'd suggest at least some holes for securing the stove legs to a platform or a way to weigh down the legs?All in all, this stove is OK - it gets the job done. I like Weber products, even if some of the QC and build quality has gone downhill in the last 10 years.I hope to enjoy my WSJ for as many years as my 18-inch (given away), my 22-inch (8 years going strong), and newest acquistion, the Smokey Joe Silver."

My 20 year old Smokey Joe recently came to its demise and there was no doubt I'd purchase another. The only difference is they now have a nylon handle instead of a wooden handle. I keep mine outside on a patio 24/7/365 and it weathers the elements without covering it. I also use mine on an old metal wrought-iron table to make for safe grilling. This is the perfect size for 1-3 people."

        "text": "Okay, I'm an addict and this is actually my fourth Weber grill...I buy one every four to five years, use it often, treat it poorly, and when it starts to show signs of age, I simply spring for a new one. Until I discovered the Weber, I seldom even got a year out of my grills - so this is quite an improvement for me. The quality of the product, and the results I get, are topnotch, and today, I wouldn't consider any other brand (except maybe a built-in Hastings - but that's another animal altogether).I go back and forth between the 22.5 inch and the 26 inch version. The 26 is more expensive, but it offers quite a bit more cooking area. It also uses quite a bit more charcoal, and to my eyes, it doesn't heat quite as evenly. Instead, I've settled on the 22.5, and on those relatively rare occasions when I need more grilling area, I just run a second grill.One thing I especially like is that Weber is so popular, you can get replacement parts just about anywhere. It's nice to know that if I open the grill in the Springtime and the grates are all rusty, I can zip over to the local hardware store and probably find an exact replacement.This time I went for the blue version, but otherwise it's the same Weber I've come to love. Easy to clean, rugged - and it cooks as well as anything out there. I'm not a fan of gas grills...they simply don't seem to get hot enough for certain uses. But with the Weber and some quality charcoal and you're all set, no matter what's on the menu.Only very small complaint is that I've had some problems with the paint peeling off under the top cover. In the past, once I noticed this happening, I simply scrubbed all the loose paint off with a wire brush...curious to see if this one has the same problem.Really recommended!"

        "text": "I'm not even sure where to start!  I've wanted to add a charcoal grill to my outdoor cooking fleet for many years just for those few times that I'd like to cook more naturally.  I've used this one 2 times so far and can't believe I've waited this long.  I think it's saved me over $1000 I was going to spend to replace my 10 yr old gas grill.This grill and a couple Weber accessories make charcoal grilling a breeze!  I haven't grilled with charcoal in years and obviously I had cheap junk for grills in the past.The quality of the grill is great, but I expected that.  I can see it lasting years and years as many others have attested to.  I'll easily use it even during the week when I don't have the time I thought it would take and thought gas was easier for.  The first use and trying to get used to charcoal again was almost a failure because I almost choked the heat down keeping the vents closed.  When I realized that the steaks slowed down cooking and the kettle top got wet from condensation it hit me that I had the vents closed thus the fire couldn't breath.  All I had to do was open the vents and 'viola, in no time the heat was back up and going strong with no other help from me, just air.Yesterday I outdid myself with ribs. Although I did cook them a little to high, they were the best I've ever done both falling off the bone and the best flavor I've ever gotten.  I was using Mesquite chips as well but I've done that on a gas grill and cooked twice as long and didn't get near the same results.  It's amazing how the kettle makes all the difference in the world keeping the charcoal hot and lasting a long time.  I'm amazed!Clean up is much easier than I expected.  The ash catcher is awesome, even in high gusty winds.  Access though the grill for adding fuel makes adding briquettes and wood a breeze.Assembly was easy and took less than 20 minutes taking my time.The only con I can come up with was that on the top handle, it came out of the undamaged box with a chip of the porcelain coming off as if it had been hit.  It's small and by the handle and not exposing the metal so it's not a functional problem but with the box arriving in perfect condition, it's obvious it happened before being packed.  However, I'd be surprised if anyone could find it.All I can say is that I'm sold!!  Everything Weber that I've bought, from the grill to the accessories, have been top notch. Charcoal grilling is now a breeze and so much better than gas.  The old saying is absolutely true; having the right tools make all the difference in the world.  The Weber Kettle is absolutely the right tool!!  Being made in the USA is the cherry on top!To address some of the complaints in the lesser ratings:The handles don't get hot.  As hot as mine has been, the handles are easy to hold with bare hands, although I tend to use a mitt around a grill.  The new handles should last in any weather condition and much longer than wood as well.It would be nice to have a temp gauge but that's not hard to add if you really need one.  I can see the benefit but it's limited.The Kettle is not unstable if it's put together right.  If it falls apart after assembling, the legs aren't being secured fully as they should be, which is to tap them all the way in.  Rolling it isn't a problem but like with most anything, you have to be careful.  Depending on which way you roll it, one might be able to knock it over if not careful, but I've not found that to be easy to do.  Standing, it's as stable as can be.  Again, if it's wobbly or falls apart as one has claimed, the legs were not assembled properly.The lid DOES have a hook to hang on the side of the kettle; it's on the underside of the top near the vent.  It hangs nicely on the side of the kettle."

Grilling outside is for leisure, take your time, relax and enjoy the flavor. So I opted for this Weber One Touch Gold - what I have been missing all these years!This grill is so easy to use. I didn't get the chimney starter, I just place some newspapers under the charcoal and it works just fine. I am usually grilling in about 15 - 20 minutes. The ash collector is fantastic, the ashes don't blow around and it makes it easy to remove the leftover ashes. I got blue, it really looks great.

Try to contact Amazon customer service on the web and was amazed that they have a \"please call me\" service. I just typed in my phone number and they call me right away. The return for a replacement is painless and they order a new one for me right away. All I need to do is put the damaged grill in the original box, re-tape it, leave it outside my front door. UPS was here the next day, pick up the box and return to Amazon. That was really easy.I finally receive my new blue grill today. It is perfect and only took me 10 minutes to assemble it. The ash tray needs a little adjustment with a plier and now it is working perfectly. I have ordered a work table and putting it in is a snap.  I also got the smokenator and it fit perfectly inside the grill. Try the cover and it fit perfectly and no gap in between with everything in place. I am a happy camper and ready to do some bbq this weekend.  The blue color looks really nice in my backyard for an extra $10.So do not get despair if you get a defect, just keep returning and you will eventually get a perfect one. It worth the wait.I am glad that I only need to return it one time. On my reasons of return, I mention this grill is defective and should not put back on the shelve and send to other customers. I also contact Weber and let them know about this so they can improve their product quality control in the future before boxing their products and send to the distributor.Hope this help and good luck."

My husband was so excited and rushed out to buy charcoal, cleaning brushes, etc.  When we got it and he opened the box we discovered one of the handles was bent, and there was a large section that had no protective paint over it, making us fear it would rust prematurely.  Needless to say we were disappointed.  He boxed it up and I called Amazon, and they were great!  They immediately sent us a return packaging slip, and placed a new order (at upgraded two day shipping no less) for us.  So, once we got all that straightened out and got the second one (which looked great by the way) we unpacked it and looked forward to making the chicken we had prepared.My husband put it together and brought it over to me and I must say, the blue looks a heck of a lot cooler than the basic black!  This is the upgraded model with the reservoir for ashes, and while I don't do a lot of grilling, my husband really appreciated this aspect of the grill.It was easy to put together, and Weber has a wonderful reputation when it comes to grill products.  The chicken we cooked on it came out wonderfully, though we have had a gas grill for the past few years, so the extra time a charcoal grill takes will take some time to get used to.All in all well worth the money.//Update March 2013: Wow. Has it already been over 3 years? I guess it has. This grill is still going strong. We clean it regularly, and keep it covered with one of the standard Weber grill covers. It has no rust and still cooks some great food. The ash catch is an absolute must have with the charcoal grills. Still very pleased with this purchase. Especially seeing as we've had other grills fall apart in little over a year."

        "text": "When it came time for us to get a new charcoal grill I searched every site and checked out dozens of different grills, some costing many hundreds of dollars, all promising some advantage.Some units were really interesting, and not too expensive, but upon close inspection many of these proved to be tinny and cheaply made. The very expensive systems were very nice, but did not offer rotisseries and other useful accessories and were just too expensive for us anyway.So, we ended up with another Weber, the Gold Model. In the many years since our last Weber, there have been a lot of improvements that kept it attractive. The ash catcher really does make cleanup much easier and the vent system is more functional. The grill itself has the new flip-up hatches that allow you to add more coals and move them around without having to lift up the grill. I did that all the time with the old grill.The optional little bent-wire style of charcoal retainers do help to keep the coals out to the side when you want to use a drip pan in the center.Others have recommended the chimney style charcoal start for ecological reasons. It is also just plain faster to use as well, and it is made of heavy gauge metal that is both attractive and long-lasting.I love the optional rotisserie (see those reviews) and it comes with an extension ring that is also useful for other cooking options.We got the green colored kettle and it looks very nice on the patio. The general design and those odd white-wall tires give it a kind of vintage look.This is a well-made and very functional grill with all sorts of interesting available accessories that really work well. There is a reason for the popularity of the Weber. I looked, I bought. Hard to beat................Update 7/2012. Still good, used daily all summer and even in the rain under my porch cover. Something I came up with that could be interesting to the more dedicated user. I essentially bought a downed oak tree and have been splitting it for firewood for next winter. Had a lot of small, crooked, knotty, twisted pieces that couldn't easily be split. I cut them up into 1\" cubes on a band saw, hoping to use them as briquettes in the Weber. A newspaper sprinkled with cooking oil got them started in the Weber chimney starter quite quickly. The secret is to be a bit patient so that they stop flaming and turn to glowing coals. And then you have a genuine oak BBQ, just like on a ranch. Very good, but a lot of work and dangerous enough even on a band saw. And it messes up the blade and rollers. The other more accessible method would be to simply start an oak campfire in the Weber, using regular old pieces of oak like you would in a fireplace. It would take some time to burn down to coals, but even more of an excuse to drink too much and then burn the food because....well, everyone has done this. Right? Anyway, flaming oak imparts a kind of bitter taste while glowing oak coals make it delicious. I do this research for you.__________________________Update 2, on cooking an expensive steak. This works and requires no skill. I went out and bought the most expensive steak ever, an organic, grass fed, free range whatever ribeye at a boutique market and the attractive butcher girl probably had her thumb on the digital scale besides. I about died when I saw the price. Hmmm, can't afford to cook this any way but perfectly.I once saw a YouTube video on how to properly cook a steak using high heat and this is my BBQ grill interpretation of that.Use the coal retainers to block off a section of the lower grill and fill up that smaller portion with lots of hot coals. It cannot be too hot in this case.Put on the cooking grill and let the previous session's grease flame off, which of course also heats it up hotly and is somewhat entertaining and makes you feel guilty about what you are eating...Put on the steak. Having those long tongs helps a lot. You can rub it with olive oil if you want, but it is unclear to me if that is necessary and it causes more flame-ups. No BBQ sauce though. Lid off! Deal with the flame-ups by maneuvering the steak around. Some people use a water spray. This is hands-on, attentive work.Stand by. It will cook fast. Have your other food well under way. Within minutes the down side will have that crust of goodness, short of burnt of course. Turn it over and do the other side. When that side is seared, remove the steak and insert a digital cooking thermometer, taking care to place it in the very center, from the side (not stabbed in from the top).  I use a Polder and the line from the sensor to the display seems to hold up in high heat, but don't string it out over the coals. Run it out the back. Set the alarm for 130.Put the steak back over the un-coaled area. The effect now is that this is a very hot oven, not a grill. Put on the lid, make sure all vents are open. Watch the temp rise, amazingly fast so don't wander off.Remove the steak, with tongs, to a plate and cover it with aluminum foil, resting it as they say on cooking shows. By the time everything else is served up, maybe 10 minutes or so, it should be ready to serve.This gives you a steak that looks exactly like the ones in advertisements, medium rare with a great crust.  You can throw it back on and in a couple of minutes the temp and doneness will go up. There is no shame in putting food back on the fire, but there is shame in over-cooking it! If you paid the big bucks for your meat, burning it will make you cry.BTW, this works for other meat like thick cut pork chops (thick ones are easier to cook properly). Use the same method, but run the temp up to 140-145 (145 being the new govt standard, and in fact it is the standard for all meat other than poultry. If you were brought up on thin, over-cooked pork chops (we all were) you have a revelation coming. Chicken parts don't require the high heat, but a quick sear and off the the oven part works very well for them.It is suggested that the steak be served with salt and pepper, applied after it is cooked as it may be a bad idea to subject the salt and pepper to high heat. The more expensive the meat, the less you should put on it. Cooks always suggest kosher salt and it is indeed very good for this, and ground pepper is better as well. I really think BBQ sauce is too much for expensive beef, but if you want to fancy it up, slowly heat up some butter and garlic and let it meld together. Strain it and serve it on the side, or simply pour it on. What the heck, you have already gone well over the fat grams or whatever for the month anyway...If you have to cook more than maybe 3 or 4 large steaks, you could fill the entire bowl with coals and then finalize them in the kitchen oven set very high, like 450, and with the temp probe stuck in the most representative steak. This gives you 90% of the grilling experience and taste."

        "text": "I have used a number of different charcoal grills, and the Weber Gold is the best.  Unless you want to spend twice the price and buy the Weber Performer, which is a Weber Gold with gas ignition, table, and a place to store charcoal. Not sure why you would want to store charcoal outside where it can absorb moisture, but that is another story.First off the Weber is made with a thicker steel, so it retains the heat better than the cheaper, lighter, offshore made products.  The grill is heavier, so you can get more than one season out of it.  The ash catcher is great.  Its a must have feature.  Other units get ashes all over my deck, which is unacceptable, and a fire hazard on windy days.My Weber Gold is about 10 years old.  I replaced the cooking grate once.  It still functions perfectly.  It lives outside and only has one tiny spot of rust, where the cover got hit with a rock and it chipped the paint.  One day I will get around to sanding and painting that spot so it lasts another 10 years.  The aluminum portions of the grill are a little weathered, but still function perfectly.  I guess if I really wanted to I could polish them up, but a little oxidation does not bother me.The only downside I can even think about is the top handle.  It is plastic, not wood.  Sometimes it gets too hot to handle so I have to use a potholder if I am cooking at a very high temperature.  Other than that, it is the best charcoal grill on the planet.Sure you can buy one cheaper, but they will not last.  Buy a Weber and you will leave it to your children when you die.

        "text": "That title was sarcasm, in case you missed it.When we bought a house almost fourteen years ago, I brought along a Weber Smokey Joe grill I had used when I was single.  We used it for the first several months of our marriage as our only grill.  Then we bought a Weber 22 1/2 inch kettle grill for our new backyard.  We have used it regularly ever since.  It works for indirect cooking of roasts and chickens, it works for direct grilling burgers, chops and sausages, it works for roasting chiles and it works as a fire pit to burn hardwood logs to fuel my large offset firebox smoker.  This grill has been out in the weather without a cover for 13 years or so and it has held up beyond reasonable expectations.  Only within the past few months has the use, age and abuse begun to take a toll.  There are several spots where the porcelain has worn away that are rusting through or already have rusted through.  The wooden handles dry rotted away.  The nuts holding the aluminum airflow disc adjusters at the bottom of the kettle rusted off.  And I'm still using it.  I did a steak and some pork chops last night, using lump charcoal and pecan hardwood chunks I chopped up myself.  They were delicious.I also have a gas grill that is convenient but does not even come close to giving the good taste you can get from charcoal and wood fuel.  Trying to use a smoker box on a gas grill is futile for me.  You can't adjust the airflow through a gas grill.  The only adjustment is the level of the flame.  I constantly find the wood chips either just burn up quickly without producing much smoke or they never heat up enough to start smoking at all.  The gas grill doesn't get much use at my house.I also use an offset firebox smoker.  It's great for doing large size pieces of meat or poultry or multiple pieces of smaller items.  It does require frequent attention to keep the fire going and the temperature within the proper range.  Honestly, the Weber grills can do the same or better job for smaller cuts of meat by cooking indirect.  About the only time I use the smoker is when I have something too large for the Weber.It's time retire the old Weber.  I've already put a One-Touch Gold on my Amazon wishlist.  I think I'll use the old grill as a planter.  I can't imagine throwing it away after all these years."

For years I got by with a ridiculously tiny hibachi -- one day I found myself living in the suburbs and somehow rationalized BUYING A REAL BARBECUE! Due to my dyed-in-the-wool cheapness and extensive researching before buying, it was inevitable that I'd end up with a Weber 22.5\" Silver Kettle Grill!YES the little tray on the bottom end is a pain in the neck. But I can't say it's really ever bothered me ALL that much! You'll want to use a charcoal chimney to light your coals -- I used to build a little fire with newspaper and sticks but the charcoal chimney is the way to go, and one chimney will nicely fill the coal area on the Silver Kettle Grill. Do not ever use lighter fluid or fuel-soaked coals. But you already know that.While you'll get the hang of burgers, hot dogs, steaks, chicken and bratwurst right away, make sure to investigate \"indirect grilling\" where you pile your coals on one side or the other (or both) and put an aluminum tray under whatever you're grilling. Like a pork roast or a whole chicken. The 22.5\" Silver Kettle Grill has AMPLE room for everything you'd like to do. Including grilling a turkey! Easy to do plus incredible flavor!I recently acquired a \"slide-aside\" cradle for the lid which I like a lot,  and a clip-on tool holder, which is really handy. We use the grill several times a week. I've never found it lacking. There are a few techniques you'll pick up to turn out just what you like, such as brining chicken or pork prior to cooking. You really do not have to spend more than this to get an excellent tool which you'll use for years and years to come. Get this larger size, but don't spend more on non-essentials. It's a zen thing. In place of a statue of Buddha, we suburbanites have Weber Kettle Grills in our backyard. Grilling harkens back to caveman days, satisfying something very deep in every red-blooded American -- meat good. fire good. Weber good.Order the hinged lid grate for this size grill -- it's a neat thing to have when you need it. And make sure to try grilled pizza dough -- it doesn't ooze through the grate like you'd think it would and the flavor is incredible.The perfect shape of the Weber Kettle Grill makes operation just about foolproof. Improvise an improved ash catcher underneath (like a big metal bucket!) and you're in business. GREAT product! This is not a frivolous purchase, you NEED one of these!"

Well folks, it's worth it.  I had to get a covered grill that wasn't as big as my car for the front porch, after all the hollering by neighbors who saw the smoke billowing from my hibachi.  After all the charcoal experimenting with my barrel grill and its cousins and a Bodum  Fyrkat, I figured, what's new?  Well, a whole lot.  While related to the Bodum, the Weber is a whole lot more versatile, and can, if you wish create a range of flavors and textures.  While the one-touch system was touted as a handy cleaning device, where it really excells is as a controllable oxygen source.  Couple that nicety with movement of the 4-hole vent in the lid and  you control both the intensity of the heated charcoals with directionality.  When you're using indirect heat, the control of the temps lay with the oxygen adjustment, whilst the direction of the heat can determine the moistness as well as the degree of charring of the food.  The heavy steel as well as the brilliantly designed cooking grate that facilitates access to the coals make for a fun time at the cookery.  The Weber is iconic; it deserves that status."

I love the one touch clean out on the bottom of the grill, that is also the vent cover.  The old kettles had a bottom vent that was just like the vent on top.  That little tab would get warmer than you want to touch with your bare fingers.  The new one has a handle that doesn't get too hot to handle.  The vents open easily, and move around the ashes in the bottom, and push them out the vent holes.Just one little piece of advice.  When you are installing the legs, pay attention to which leg goes where.  The one that is different goes in the hole right under the handle.  I hasve both seen and owned grills that have the wrong leg in the wrong hole, and that makes the handle on the side, intstead of the front. It is an easy fix, but easier to pay attention the first time."

The handles have gone from wood to a resin, but they work well. Grilling or smoking, this unit has proven itself worth the money.I wrestled between buying the Silver or the Gold model, but what swayed me was that on Weber's site, the Silver shows \"Made in USA\" while the Gold does not. The reviewers for the Gold, here on Amazon, state that the box says \"Assembled in USA\", or something like that. The Weber site has no mention of any of it. I decided to avoid the issues that some with the Gold were reporting and I went with the Silver. It is very solid and I am glad I did."

The utterly inadequate ash/ember pan allows a mild breeze to blow the ash and embers out onto flamable surfaces...like your deck, your pine straw, or house. For an extra 50 bucks you can get an upgraded model that has an enclosed ash/ember containment system. If you live in areas prone to dryness or wildfires, you could be taking a big chance with this unsafe grill. I love the way a Weber cooks, but this model is needlessly risky.  And if you have one of these grills,  take precautions like putting a metal bucket under this grill. A paint can works nicely and you can buy clean empty paint cans at Lowes. This will help reduce the fire risk and will keep ash from blowing around wildly.....it also makes getting rid of ash an easy task. If you value the property you live in, or think you owe your neighbors some due diligence, avoid this flame thrower."

But I got tired of waiting for charcoal to heat up, and went on to propane.  I never got good results with gas.  After wasting way too many years destroying food on gas grills, I came home to charcoal and Weber.  This time around I know what I'm doing, and the Weber is giving me Fantastic results.  The 22 1/2 kettle is a great all around cooker.  It grills, sears, bakes and does a very good job of \"low and slow\" smoking.  If you only have the room or desire for one cooker, get this one without hesitation.  It won't smoke quite as good as a real smoker, but unless you're a perfectionist, you'll never know the differance.  The 18 inch grill is a great cooker too, but because it's smaller it's harder to smoke on it.  So if you have the room, get this model.  The lid and bowls are built like a tank.  I found the unit wiggles around where the legs attach, even though I assembled it correctly.  The older ones don't wiggle.  But that's progress.  I don't think it's a problem though, just an observation.  I was torn between 4-5 stars because of that.  They have been building these forever, so assesories and replacement parts can be had easily.Built solid, mutliple uses, food tastes great, easy to use.  Not much else to say."

        "text": "Alright,I am one that loves to grill, but doesn't know anything about grills themselves, really. Due to monetary situations I had to grill on the cheapest possible grill... The green Sunbeam camper grill. I'm sure you know what grill I'm talkin' about. For over 6 years it has been my grill of choice (hey it was only $10!) and has treated me well. Over these years I always dreamed about owning a \"real\" charcoal grill. I wanted the American icon, I wanted the Weber One-Touch. I heard all about how durable and well built it was, how it will last for 10 years+ and how it's just a step above the rest. After actually purchasing this grill I have a bit of buyers remorse. You see, before actually buying this I was looking at a grill from Char-Broil. It had the ash catching pan like the One-Touch gold, it had space to put plates and such (sorta like the One-Touch Platinum) and it had grates with adjustable height, not to mention all of this came at a price just $5 higher then the One-Touch Silver! Anyways, for the last 2 years I wanted nothing more then the Weber so I got it. Once I started puting it together I realized that this grill just doesn't seem to have $80 worth of craftsmanship. The legs are super-flimsy hollow aluminum pipes, very cheap. The itsy bitsy tabs that hold the bottom grate are slightly uneven so my bottom grate is a bit wobbly (also it's possible for the bottom grate to fall because the tabs are pretty small). A wobbly bottom grate probably doesn't make a lick of difference when it comes to grilling, it's just that it wasn't right, it's just one of those little annoying quirks. I guess I expected everything to be heavy duty. I expected solid metal legs and such. You can find an identical grill from Char-Broil for less then half the cost! I hear that Weber is a step above because they are built to last... well my cheap $10 Sunbeam is 6+ years old and I've never had any problems with it, it's all about how you take care of it. Personally, I think for the $80 price tag of the One-Touch silver, you should at least get the hinged cooking grate, but you don't.There are good things however. First, it's just nice to have the American icon. There is a certain feeling that comes with grillin' on the good ol' Weber kettle. There are a TON of accessories made for it and replacement parts are extremely easy to find. The one-touch system is pretty handy (although hardly one-touch).Overall I am still happy with the purchase, I love looking at that grill. It's probably gonna grown on me more and more as years pass by. Based on price I decided to get the Silver version, but the Gold might be worth looking at. Afterall you get a much better ash-pan (I modified my silver to be just as good though... just a little creativity should do the trick) and you get the hinged grate with the gold (although you can just buy this grate for $15-$20 and stick it on your Silver if you wanna)Choose... but choose wisely.YEAR UPDATE-----------------------------------------------------Okay, now it's been over a year since I posted my original review. This really is a great grill, I wish I could bump the stars up to 4, but I can't... Amazon wont let me. Some of the minor quams I said previously still apply, but this baby cooks a mean dish! I have abused mine for a year and it runs like brand new.What really made me do this update was when I grilled on a buddy's kettle. It wasn't a weber kettle and it shows. After a year of using this I got to know this grill really well, I got used to such high quality materials. This grill really is above and beyond most other kettle style grills.I do wish I would have purchased the gold though. The ash pan that comes with the silver is not much use if you're grilling in any sort of wind."

Besides the black metal kettle part, everything else seems to be of terribly cheap quality and not what I would expect in this price range.- The legs and bottom frame are made of shockingly thin and weak metal. I wouldn't buy my kids toys with such cheap trashy metal.- The wheels are made of cheap hard hollow one-sided plastic. Again, I would not buy a children's toy with such cheap wheels.- The side handle melted during the first use when we hung the lid from it while cooking.Let's face it. This is a lot of money for a basic charcoal grill. You are paying for quality and looks. I gave it four stars only on the merit that there simply isn't a viable competitor right now.

What I didn't consider was that a larger grill will give you lots of additional options for indirect cooking and smoking. The 18.5 just doesn't have the space, even for a small family. If you only want to cook burgers and hot dogs for 3 to 4 people, the 18.5 will serve fine but you won't have much versatility.Now that I've \"grown\" as a griller, I wish I had the One-touch Platinum.

Just be sure the cage is completely level and the trigger arm nor the door is rubbing up against anything to obstruct or slow down the releasing of the trap door.However, ground squirrels are clever little critters.  Most times you come out and see the door sprung and the food gone is because they tried getting the food out the other end of the cage through the wire - and they can do that.  I cut a piece of OSB to completely cover the other end of the outside of the cage and tied it on with wire. The first time I used heavy cardboard - they ripped it to shreds to get to the food. Then all you have to do is upend the cage - drop something covered with peanut butter in (I use graham crackers)- it will stick to the wire and OSB (also slowing down the squirrel just enough to trip the pan).  Use a little stick if you have to, to mash it to the wire and OSB.  Another good bait are apple strips.  These are made with apple peelers that have the little crank.  The whole apple peel comes off in one strip.  This also slows down the squirrel and the apple peel will cover part of the pan.  Bigger items like this are more successful than small ones.It was more work taking the critters away and releasing them that catching them.This is a perfect size to catch ground squirrels - the size down is a bit small - this one has more room they have to cover to trip the pan - in other words they can't just dangle half their body in, grab the food and leave without getting near the pan."

        "text": "Over the summer, I was constantly noticing piled mulch in my beds and every time I would go to flatten it back out I would find a cat poop covered up; not only a pain to clean up but also a health hazard too.  After checking the security tapes I found it was a feral cat problem we had.  I found this trap on Amazon and saw a good majority of the reviews were favorable and decided to give it a try.  Setup out of the box was a little confusing at first but the kit is mostly assembled out of the box.  The only parts you have to assemble are the pole from the step that triggers the door to a hook on the door and to secure the back of the cage closed.  It was a bit of a challenge to get the pole from the step to the door to line up but it seemed so simple after getting it together.This trap is very durable.  Solidly constructed, pre-assembly out of the box was a positive.  The first night I set up the trap with a small paper plate of a little bit of wet cat food.  I checked on the trap after a couple hours and had caught my first feral cat.  I transferred it to a different cage to take to the shelter the next day and set the trap up again.  All told over about a week I had caught nearly 8 feral cats, I couldn't believe there were that many in my neighborhood.  What is great about this trap is the assembly of the door, easy to open and release the animal should you be looking to relocate an animal such as opossum's or groundhogs.  The best thing you can do is to cover the trap with an old towel.  Not only will it help protect you from clawing animals but I found that it helped to calm the animal and also kept the trapped animal from giving away what the trap really is to other animals.For the price, this is a really durable animal trap and I have been satisfied to own it.  I've even lent it to a few friends and they have told me they had great results capturing their troublesome creatures of the night.  The best part is the unit can be easily broken down to store flat against the wall, and can pop back together quite quickly when you need it."

An unadvertised benefit is that these have a \"built in alarm\" of the catch. The mouse (or mice) will push around on the one way ramp which make a metallic tapping sound to alert you of their presence in the trap.If you want to release live, thats great, but if you want to dispose of the mice, just take the trap and set it in the sun for a bit and the mice will expire fairly quickly."

I've tried every type of mouse trap on the market, including spring traps, repeating traps, electronic traps, etc.  The old-fashioned spring traps are the best and cheapest solution, but they can be a bit gruesome.  This tin cat trap is the most reliable alternative I've found.  When I hear, see, or smell mice, I put this out and invariably end up finding mice in it the next morning.  The first tin cat that I bought almost 20 years ago is still catching mice.A few important notes:- This is only a live catch mouse trap if you check it daily.  You can't expect to catch mice, leave them in the trap for a week, and expect to find live critters the next weekend.  If they die in the trap, you'll face a smelly clean up task.- I noticed a lot of reviews from people who said the trap stopped working.  In my experience, this is almost always because something has gotten wedged under the trap-door ramp.  Often it seems to be because the mice crawl into the semi-enclosed trap door spaces to die if you don't empty the trap in time.  If the trap is outdoors, twigs and bits of sand can blow up the trap-door ramps and keep them from working.  95% of the time, just banging the trap on the ground a few times dislodges whatever is in the way.  About 2-3 times a year, I spray off the inside of the trap with a garden hose, which seems to clean out remaining debris just fine.In a nutshell:  This is a great trap design that consistently catches mice and has worked for me for decades.  In my experience, the trap has proven to be very reliable and durable with an occasional bit of cleaning."

One day passed with no action, but after a whole lot of rain yesterday evening, the mole was in the trap this morning!He was caught in the edge of the jaws, telling me I could have planted the trap a tiny bit deeper.  There is another method advocated online involving digging out a section of the mole run, building a dirt bridge across the hole, placing the trap down in the hole, and covering with dirt.  This might be an even better strategy, but either way, I'm happy with the result.  I left the traps out, just in case another mole decides to make use of his subterranean highway system.

        "text": "Update June 3, 2011More mole activity which has now been stopped by a Victor trap. This time the activity was in the back yard including a flower bed. I decided to skip the test pressing phase and just selected a mole run, pressed the soil down and placed the trap. Sure enough the next day I had a dead mole in the trap. I had set two traps and the second one didn't catch anything so they are both back in the garage waiting for the next mole trapping adventure.Original reviewFive hours after I set two traps I had trapped a mole; I was truly surprised to see one trap sprung and at first thought it must have accidently tripped; I pulled the trap out of the ground and there was a dead mole, the trap had done its job perfectly.I had lived at my house for over 30 years and this mole infestation was a first. When I started seeing the raised soil trails and dead grass I suspected I had somehow gotten a mole in my yard. I started reading everything I could find on the web and started getting free advice from friends.I called the pest service we use and the man suggested I buy the Victor trap as that was the one they used and the cost of them coming out and setting the traps could get very expensive. I read the Amazon reviews on the trap and they were generally helpful so I decided to buy the Victor traps.The general advice was to locate active runs by pressing down the soil that had been displaced by the mole which I did and then followed up with a hose to really flatten them down. Sure enough the following day certain trails had been raised up again and I selected one of those to place the traps.My yard has a sandy soil mixed with clay; it is also rather root infested so I followed several recommendations which said it was important to cut away any roots that might hinder the traps free movement. Before I placed the trap that caught the mole; I used a straight edged steel edger and pressed it down into the soil where the trap would be placed; sure enough I had to cut through several roots that crossed that area. I used my foot to press down the raised area where the trap would be placed.It took a little experimentation to finally get the trap set; I had never set a trap before so this was all new to me. It does take some pressure to set the trap; there is a safety latch which can be engaged first but then additional pressure with the tools provided is needed to actually set the trigger.I left the safety latch in place until the trap was set in the ground and I had pressed it down so the trigger was resting on the soil. Once that was all done I released the safety latch and the trap was ready.I covered the trap with a garden pot to keep the area dark and protect it from being disturbed by local cats and dogs. This was all done late yesterday morning and by mid afternoon it had trapped a mole.I will update this review if anything of interest happens. In the meantime both traps are in place waiting for the next mole."

If your \"out o sight\" trap is out of sight it is TOO DEEP and all you will get is holes in your yard and perhaps an annoyed mole.When the very expensive exterminator (who we now refer to as \"Mark the Mole Man\") came to our house, I showed him our \"out of sight\" mole trap. He tried to be respectful but finally just said, \"Ma'am, that's too deep. Ain't gonna kill nothin'.\" As it turns out, this is exactly the same type of trap he uses. He just knows how to use it correctly.He pulled it up and knocked the dirt off and walked around the yard for a while telling me stuff about moles. He clearly took great pride in his mole murdering skills (please don't give PETA my address.) Finally he stopped, stood silently for a moment, then he stepped his boot gently on a run until the soil was level with the surrounding soil. Next he took his special tool for making the slits that the previous reviewer described making with a shovel, and he made his two slits in the run for the blades to fit into.Then, artist that he was, Mark the Mole Man pressed the trap blades slowly into the slits he had made until the flat trigger was sitting gently on the soil. Released the safety and - Done. He placed three more in the back yard (BIG yard) and 24 hours later we had a dead mole.It was a wonderful (and for us expensive) experience. Go get your nasty little critter with this trap, but don't follow their directions. Listen to reviewer Geoffrey Klos."

Perhaps they work in pairs with one holding the door open while the other goes in for the food. With a heavy heart I next purchased a pair of these traps. For many nights the mice could count on their evening meal, the bait strategically placed in various places in this trap. They walzed in, dined, and left, no doubt laughing their little tails off.  It seems a human with a master's degree in psychology is no match for the average rodent.  Then, wonder of wonders, last night the traps actually lured two hapless diners to their death. My delight was short lived upon reading reviews here that the mice do not die instantly, but might suffer for a time before expiring. What's a person to do?  My advice, if you do purchase this type trap, is to use just the smallest amount of bait (my successful last night bait was cream cheese) which I rubbed the entire length of the pressure activated metal strip. I think previously I was using too large a piece of cheese or cream cheese.

Happy with the refills and the way they are packaged and installed.For the trap itself:I have 2 of these for 2 different locations.  Four stars instead of five because they do trap fleas; but they won't arrest an infestation. I use them as an indicator of the severity of the problem and whether I'm getting it under control.  Fleas are hard to see and find on carpet and furniture, not so tough to find on the dogs.The traps work best at night, don't seem to do much of anything during the day.  If I think I might have a problem or know the dogs have fleas I get the traps out.  This year we were successful with Siphotrol spray on the carpet and furniture and Barklogic's Lemongrass shampoo on the dogs (separate reveiws for those).  I count the fleas in the flea traps on a daily basis so I can tell that those measures are being effective, and when the overnight catch count goes to zero that's a good indicator the fleas are gone.If you are hoping the flea trap will cure an infestation by itself, there's a good chance you'll be disappointed.

The jet is great.  The pattern ring doesn't turn quite as easily as my Toro nozzle, nor is the trigger quite as easy to squeeze, but both are quite doable even with arthritis in my hands and the lock is easy to flip into place so you don't have to squeeze the trigger for long periods.  The patterns are so much more effective than the more expensive red and silver Toro, I'm definitely replacing others with this one when needed.

I used to live on nearly and acre of property with a row of pines along the back.  They would get all brown near the bottom so I would try and prune them up to about the point where they could get enough sun to stay green. To do that you need a pruner with a little reach to it?I saw this model on TV and hunted it down, finding it first on Amazon.  I could barely believe the price quoted on the TV show, (it wasn't a commercial, it was a how-to show) they said the stick only cost about [$$$].  Its not quite that cheap, but the quality here is excellent.  It uses a chain, not unlike a bike chain, to drive the extended cutter. It uses a slider, leverage system to pull the chain to make the cuts.  The cutting blades themselves are very sharp and can be adjusted to any angle.  This becomes an important concern when you have about a dozen pine trees to trip.The stick will also do fine when you don't need the extended length.  Remember those hedge trimmers that looked like a huge pair of scissors?  I used to hurt my wrists every year, trying to get enough momentum to trim the bushes in front of the house I was renting.  If you tried to cut too, slow it would get stuck, too fast, and the handles would stop abruptly hurting my wrists!  This cutter, although smaller than a hedge trimmer, cut so quick and easily that it made trimming the bushes a pleasure.  I could even get lazy, and sit down in a chair, and do them from a distance. Try that with your electric model! The bushes never shaped up so well before.The blades will cut close to a one-inch branch, and I haven't had to sharpen it yet.  Just keep the chain free of dirt, and keep a little mower oil on it, or cycle spray and it continues to work like new.  Sometimes they just make a tool that becomes the defacto standard for a while, and for my money this is it.  Don't risk cutting your arm off with a chainsaw. If you've got a little pruning to do, get this Pruning Stik and start clipping away."

We use the electric string trimmer to trim the grass against the fence around our entire yard. As for all the other trimming in the yard- around the house, the garage, around bushes, trees, sidewalks, the patio, gardens, corners and utility poles, these Fiskars Grass Shears are just perfect!These shears are meant to trim grass and lighter plants, not anything thick, but since grass is always growing around everything in our yard, they get a constant workout.  The 3 foot height is just perfect- no bending or stooping ever. There is an orange turning device on the blades, allowing you to turn these blades to any angle you need. The blades actually turn a full 360 degrees. The 5 inch blades are fully hardened for long lasting sharpness and also lock for storage or when you are turning them. We noticed they do come with a slight oil on the blades themselves.I contacted Fiskars and asked about any maintenance for the blades, and they told me they should stay sharp for years, but you could add a sharper edge to them in time with a hand sharpener- similar to a lawn mower blade sharpener. Cleaning and lightly oiling them when they become dirty will keep them cutting perfect.  Fiskars actually has a lifetime guarantee against any defects in workmanship.  For under $35.00, these are a must have for saving my back and knees with the constant maintenance of yard trimming. These are not just for older people, as I've always had bad knees- and I wish I had known about these years ago!The thought of trimming all the constant grass around the yard made me not want to do it. I'd have to get out my small shears, my knee pad or a stool to sit on- depending on the height of the grass or weeds. Afterwards, I'd need my heating pad and linament for my aching back and knees, not to mention Aleve or some other pain killer. Spending so much time in pain made me dread trimming. Now, I just grab the Fiskars Long Handled Shears- stand, trim and that's it.

Yes, it does work, but not very well. Yes, it's sharp out of the box, but won't stay that way for long.  I'll take a wild guess and say that no one in their R&D; department actually used the finished product.  If they did, they'd realize that it's an effective trimmer for 10 sq feet of grass (maybe less).  After that, ergonomics, build quality, and most importantly, fundamental design flaws reveal how a great idea can become a poorly executed product.First, the blades need to ride above the grass by way of wheels or some sort of slick bump underneath.  Second, the steering knob needs to be larger, adjustable, and attach to the pole instead of the top handle.  Third, the gauge of wire should be beefed up - there's too much flex in the existing one.  Fourth, the pole should be at least 4\" longer. Fifth, the quality of plastic could be upgraded for use in a harsher environment (or dispose of plastic altogether).  Lastly, the blades should at the very least, be made out of steel -- bonus points for drop forged and hardened!I completely understand the price point vs quality quandary manufacturers face, but here they really took the low-end, budget approach.  It seems Fiskars tried to implement their fine line of inexpensive scissors to the lawn/garden environment.  The quality of materials is perfectly suited for indoor gardening, but who here has a living indoor lawn?I guess we'll have to give it a little more time before human-powered lawn equipment becomes available in a wider selection and price points.  I'd definitely be one of the first in line for a better version."

I wouldn't recommend it for professional u because of the exposed coil spring which is likely get clogged or damaged under heavy abuse, but it's great for the home owner.This performs the job of countless other cutting implements (small sheers to a medium duty lopper).  It's not a delicate cutter, but until recently, I was using it to deadhead my flowers with good results."

I've even used it for branches that were probably too thick for the tool, but when you have it handy, sometimes you use a tool for a purpose that it wasn't intended. Even when I try to go through something too large, it hasn't broken or jammed in such a way where I couldn't remove it and take it from another angle to finish the cut. That shows how durable it really is.I've had no issues with using this pruner for all those tasks, as it allows me to trim individual faded rose buds with one hand. The spring-loaded handle keeps the resistance at the right amount so it isn't necessary to fiddle around with it just to keep a decent grip.If I were to lose this pruner, or if it were to finally break, I would not hesitate to purchase another one as a replacement. I'm very satisfied with it and recommend it to anyone looking for this type of tool."

        "text": "When I placed my order I had some misgivings about these hand pruners. That is because I could not tell by Amazon's photo if this was the pruner I needed and how sturdy it is. Since I have had good luck with Fiskars I decided to go ahead and order it.I received the pruners today and I am going to break one of my rules on writing a review. I prefer to wait and use the product before doing a review. I am doing this because these are obviously TOP QUALITY pruners. Arthritis sufferers please take note of what I am about to say.The very first thing I noticed about the pruners is that the bottom handle ROTATES as you squeeze them. This allows you to put far more power into using these with a LOT LESS effort. A wonderful feature if you do not have a strong grip.The photo made these pruners look to me like they were mostly plastic. I immediately saw that I was wrong. All the parts that count are of high quality metal. I will not use them on large branches but I think they could be used on large branches in a pinch.As soon as I got them out of the box I just had to try them. They were excellent for clipping off very small branches in areas where there was not much room to operate. They are SO EASY to use. Once done with the smaller branches I went to larger ones. They cut them with ease. The literature that came with them claimed that they can cut branches up to 3/4 inch. I believe they could but I refuse to do it. I like these clippers so well that I want to take very good care of them so that means I will not cut branches that size with them. I want these clippers to last a long time for me.In conclusion I am very impressed with these clippers. I intend to post some of my own pictures of these clippers on Amazon because I believe I can do a bit better job. I have never done that before with an Amazon product. That is how impressed I am with these pruners. If I run into a problem with them I WILL EDIT this review as soon as it occurs. I very much doubt I will have to do that. I think 99% of all people who buy these pruners will be happy with them."

I got this 15\" Fiskars pruner this weekend in local home improvement store and spent several hours cutting my pesky vines.  The pruner worked great! It cut every vine I found and it was easy!The pruner weights 13 ounces, and has a PowerGear design that really helps amplify the strength needed to do the cutting.  I am attaching a collage of 5 photos (you can find the photos by following 'customers photo' link under the main photo).  The photos show the pruner and some of the vines I cut and took home to measure.Photo #1 and photo #2 show the pruner opened and closed.

And to clarify-these were 1\"-3\" saplings. While it handled the recommended size of 2\" easily, I found with some maneuvering and going around the tree in a circle I could also take down larger ones. Then I worked on cutting the smaller branches off, all still cutting with ease like they were brand new. No dulling or sticking- a perfect cut each time.I worked at this for about an hour- plus all the other times I've been out with these...

I'm not the strongest person out there and I'm certainly no Hercules, but these loppers made the trim job for me fairly easy.Although these may be harder to use in dense shrub because you need a wide opening for these to work effectively, once you have a grip on the wood the cutting is easy.  And, since they are somewhat long, you can also reach up rather high.  Overall, a very well-engineered set.They are attractive on top of it, and look impressive in my tool corner."

One reviewer gave it one star because the blade is curved so you have to open the tool's jaws slightly more.

As I was applying the oil I noticed that the black cutting blade had a bright spot. Closer inspection revealed the bright spot was actually a nick in the blade. This was a major letdown after the feeling that resulted from the cutting prowess. I had to delete a star due to the nick and hope that it was just a  rare flaw in the metal.

Funny, because on the fiskars website there's no mention of the product!I compared it to other alternatives, that can cut 2\" branches, and this model came out as number one!It cuts wood like butter!Mine is very light weight, has titanium blade, hollow aluminum arms, with rubber handles.I fear I bought a product that may be more powerful than the product can actually handle! Meaning, it may be good for casual use of cutting branches upto 2\".But perhaps not industrial use!That's why they probably decreased the size of the gripper to 25\" and 31\" instead of 32\".Nevertheless, I just use it for some thorn bushes in my garden, and think it's well worth the $30 I spent!Even mine (32 inch) is very light weight, I can easily lift it up with one arm stretched, to cut off the furthest branches, and I'm a pretty skinny and weak guy!One cutting blade seems titanium, the other some sort of treated metal alloy. Only one of the two is a blade, the other is just a hold for the branch.Unlike other branch cutters I've seen, this one cuts the branch like a scissor, not squeezes the branch like pliers; which means, you won't have branches hanging on threads still on the tree.The cutting mechanism provides clean and easy cuts that separate even the toughest branches (upto 2 inch)!I highly recommend this one!; and that's very high praise coming off of my lips! (those who know me, know I'm usually very skeptic, and thorough in reviewing the bad sides).If anything bad about this device, is that it's not on the manufacturers website (the 32 inch model), and that it's probably not made for mass pruning on an industrial scale, eventhough it would probably outlive a DIY-er pruning gardens in his days off!"

        "text": "I've usually found Fiskars gardening products to be innovative and effective, but there's usually a kink in the design.  I still swear by the Power Lever shears because the blades move parallel and effortlessly, but the kink is the retaining pin which is a pressure fit which simply loosens with use as the hole in the blades enlarge.  As to this very lovely and innovative Power Gear lopper, well, let's say there are a lot of kinks.  As you may have discovered, the handles break and the blades are fragile.  Just how fragile?  Check Home Depot's website for feedback on this very lopper and you'll even see pictures of the chipped Titanium blade.  It happens a lot, a whole lot.  Quality control may well be to blame, but the material used in the titanium blade is just not solid or steel.  My blade broke or rather chipped the first week of use and the broken surface revealed something that looks like pot metal.  The material in the blade looks like a composite, a grainy composite.  If you look at the blade you'll see that's it's very hefty and designed to withstand a direct applied force, but apparently not a force related to twisting, which would act against the cutting edge with increased leverage due to the unusual depth of the blade and its almost rectangular shape.  So you have high tech materials that when working, operates as advertised, save for that extra span needed to clear the blade around let's say a 2 inch branch.  BUT here's the good news:  Fiskars has replacement blades.  Here's the not so good news:  Fiskars charged me a reasonable $7.99 for the blade, but a very, very hefty shipping and handling ($4.00 for the handling) charge of $11.39, making the modestly priced blade $19.38 to purchase and receive.  The replacement blade (they're determined by the distance between the mounting holes)is steel and shaped like traditional lopper blades:  no more composites, no more thick blades, which tells you something.  As to Power Gear hedge shears, well , count your blessings with the lopper, because there ain't no replacement parts for the hedge shears from Fiskars, and their kink is the composite Power Gear mechanism, which breaks teeth with a passion, rendering the unit useless, unless you have a similarly wounded twin, because the mechanisms are comprised of two sets of power gear parts, that are interchangeable front and rear.  There you go, have fun."

It makes taking off snips of dill easy without damaging the plant or taking off too much.  It is also precise if you are selectively trimming small sections.The handles have a spring action device that requires almost zilch pressure and is comfortable and easy to use even when mounting a morning of garden maintenance. I used it for two hours today and my hands felt fine ----- no stiffness or discomfort.The cost is appealing. Small garden tools can get pricey and since I paid about $8 for these I thought they were reasonable."

I've tried other brands and didn't like them as well. Keep in mind this is for cutting thin, tiny deadheads. It's not a pruning shear, it's for very detailed deadheading or nipping of very small stems.If you're doing a lot of delicate pruning like this, I'd also recommend picking up some of those thin Atlas Nitrile Touch gloves.

(Of course, I didn't want to steal all the fun of harvesting our green beans, so I bought my husband his own pair...)We love Fiskars products--they are sturdy and built to last and blades are good and sharp.  Blades stay sharp for a long time, then take very well to a sharpener.Regarding bonsai:  This snipper is too large for bonsai work:  The blades are not fine and small and exact enough.I did find another Fiskars snipper, a bit longer in the handle and the blades, that I find better for using on roses.  Longer handles and longer blades keep my fingers further away from the thorns and that's a good thing.  I looked for that product here on Amazon, but didn't find it.  I just mention it so you can be on the lookout.  The handles are different and there is a hook on the bottom of the handles to hold them together.UPDATE July 2013:  We now have only one pair...I used it to snip a small Japanese eggplant and one of the blades snapped right at the joint.  It is very vulnerable at the joint because of the hole that is drilled in each blade where they are joined together.  So, it's still a great snipper for very delicate things, but nothing more."

They cut them into 2-3 foot sections (and a couple 6-8 foot sections... thanks a lot!) and left them where they lay. I cut them into standard 16\" sections with a chainsaw and got to work on them (still pretty green) with this axe.First piece I hit was a smaller section, only about 8 inches or so thick and maybe 10 in diameter. I struck dead center on the first swing, and the halves flew apart about 6 feet, leaving me with my axe burried about 2 inches deep in my chopping stump. For the smaller length pieces like this, I only really had to let this axe fall with its own weight.On to the larger pieces...I put the first 16 inch log, about 10\" diameter, up on the stump and had a one-hit split on that one, too. Now, I'm not a big guy (5'6\"), and I have only split firewood 2 or 3 times in my life. My buddies showed me proper technique on a camping trip so I wouldn't cut my leg off, but that's all the training I had. I really only planned to test the axe out on a couple pieces and save the rest for another day, but it was so much fun splitting the wood with this axe, I finished the whole lot! Not all of them were one-strike splits, mind you, and some of the more twisted or knotty pieces gave me a little trouble. This is not a magic axe. But it got through everything, including pieces that came from where the tree bifurcated. Many of my splits ended with the axe burried in the stump I was chopping on, even after going through a nice 16\" log. Left me sweaty and smiling.I also like to smoke meat, so I used it to chop some of the scrap-sized logs into chunks for my smoker. It worked well for this, but I think I'm going to buy the x7 hatchet for that purpose in the future. This axe was a little too heavy and long-handled to easily take care of the smaller work. Still, I split a large box of wood chunks with it by \"choking up\" on the handle and am thrilled with the results.I would buy this again or recommend it to others in a heartbeat. I haven't truly put it through the paces yet, and I haven't had any (major) overstrikes, so I'll try to remember to update this review in the future to reflect any problems or continued success with it."

Two were regular axes, the fiberglass handle on the one split and frayed, the head on the other came off and was not repairable. Regular axes have their place, but if you're splitting all day long they are NOT what you want.I had an old school wooden splitting maul axe I got from a buddy that I used for about two seasons, and I thought it was the best thing ever. However it weighed over 12lbs. A great muscle builder, but not quite as fun when you get older. I came across a similar splitting maul at Lowes, TrueTemper. It was great that it only weighed 7lbs, and I found I could split more in a day with it using faster swings. After 4 seasons with that, constant resharpening, I came across the hardest Oak I've ever seen. I was really struggling with the TrueTemper, finding myself constantly having to take double swings to get through a piece (sometimes more). It was embarrassing almost, until I had a party one night and 4 different guys tried the axe on this tree and all failed equally. It was perfectly sharp and at the proper angle, I just couldn't easily get through the wood..Then I found this.. I instantly found myself just TEARING through the wood, like it was nothing. I honestly couldn't believe it. This axe is 6.25lbs, about 3/4lb lighter then the TrueTemper. So I could more easily, and with slightly more speed swing it. I think the key to it's victors is the angle of the blade and the maul/wedge. The blade edge (long ways) angles back towards the handle so when you strike the wood you don't have to compensate for the axe to hit it at the perfect angle (although depending on the wood height you still need to hit it right). Then the wedge is a much lesser degree of incline then the Lowes, that the maul has a chance of getting into the wood and pushing through before the maul starts splitting it apart. The Lowes one had a much steeper angle towards the edge of the blade, so it on really hard wood it was getting stuck there as soon as the blade touched the wood.There's honestly no other splitting maul options in my mind. I could never recommend anything other then this, because it is simply the best in all splitting situations. Other good points on it is :-corrosion resistant head steel (although please don't leave it outside, it will dual the edge)-hollowed out handle thats even more lightweight, but EXTREMELY strong-lifetime limited warranty-strong head through handle design, looks much more durable then your standard axe or maul-head cover to protect the blade and anyone/thing that might come in contact with it.I also recommend getting theFiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpenerand hitting it frequently. I usually don't go more then a 1/4 of a cord without sharpening, sometimes an 1/8th. It definitely makes it a lot more easier to split - especially for hard or wet wood."

I'm 6'4\" and yes, the first couple of strikes I noticed the difference in the length of the handle - however if you follow proper form when splitting wood, you are in absolutely no danger of hitting your shins or feet.

Thanks Amazon.Let me say in general I despise Fiskar tools and never buy them. While some are very well designed the price point demanded by all you people who buy made in China or made India lousy products at Home Depot means Fiskar has to lower the price point to where the quality is not commercial. Fiskar tools in general are not commercial and I have destroyed or worn out every Fiskar tool in short order as I have a large property and commercial orchards and timber land and  my tools are heavily used especially by the 'help' that does not have to pay for the tools.In general I stick with Gransfour Bruks (Sweden), Vaughn (USA), Estwing (USA), Milwaukee (USA-electric saw), Silky Saws /cutting hatchets (Japan) or the professional Grade Husqvarna chainsaws when it comes to felling timber.I took down a big ponderosa pine and was splitting it green. My  near six pound maul was having problems with the big rounds as the wood was very wet. And it is a hassle to use a wedge and 8/10 pound hammer. And my 8 lb maul had a broken handle.Gransfour Bruks does not make an 8 lb maul. I checked the USA sources. No one made an 8 lb maul.I checked with Craftmans who while they do give a lifetime guarantee make their 8 lb Mauls in China now. So no 8 lb splitting mauls made in the USA anymore that I could find, if you know of one let me know. I have my old 8 pound maul head which was made by Craftsman in the USA but have to find a handle for it. Glad I saved the head now.China  is gutting the USA with its currency rigging and we send them fake paper money and they send lousy products with a lot of 'cheating' in the steel quality so fat cat Home Depot Shareholders and Fat Cat Chinese sweat shop owners is all you have and then you get a lousy axe and the \"opportunity' to make yourself poorer and Home Depot Shareholders and the Communist Chinese richer. And a sharp, well designed long lasting tool is the safest tool.Sad to see Craftsman Tools which are nearly commercial grade  go to China. People buying these cheap made in China tools at Home Depot or Sears are hurting us all and especially the people who need commercial grade tools or the 20 pc of America that is unemployed. It is unethical to buy tools made in communist china or india as they use slave labor and you're taking a job away from an American/Canadian and china/india rigs it currency to give its manufacturers the ability to drive USA quality vendors out of business. Buy local. It is 'greener' for this politically correct generation of MTV bra....er kids to buy local.I was very skeptical about the review about this axe, given my prior experience to wear out Fiskar tools in no time or have the help break them in no time,  but I ordered one against my better judgement as Fiskar tools are at least made in Finland which has good protection for labor. And the Finns have a big timber cutting industry they manage well so I suspected maybe the Axe was better or the Finns would just buy the Granfours Bruks' axes from Sweden. So the pressure was on Fiskars to come up with something world class. They surely delivered. This is a superb tool!!This axe is very, very well balanced and designed,  as well balanced and designed as the Gransfour Bruks splitting axe or splitting maul which is saying a lot. It splits like a dream and has the same splitting ability as an 8 lb maul at a much lighter weight which really, really surprised me. So it is particularly good for older people like me that are starting to have trouble with swinging the big mauls all day. The ergonomics are perfect for a 6 foot tall man. The blade keeps its splitting edge well. Splitting a Cord of Pine is near effortless. The only problem is I don't get the good workout anymore the splitting is so effortless. You might not even break a sweat splitting with this axe if you touch up the edge after every cord with a stone. I'm a strong big guy and I was splitting wet 1 foot ponderosa rounds with a 3/4 raise and one arm. It Split just from the gravity fall with the dull factory edge. Truly amazing. Not even my Gransfour splitting axe does that and they shipped it with a dull edge for safety when I tried the dull edge first cut test with just a one arm 3/4 raise. This axe was truly amazing once I put a professional edge on it and got after those 30 in rounds with no problems although you do need some skill to crack a wet 30 inch round on the first go.FYI - Never ever take a splitting axe or maul behind your head. Learn to split and/or you need to get a heavier axe. I never take ad axe behind my head and have never seen professional fallers or buckers to so at least back in the days when they did not have chainsaws and people learned how to use an axe properly.I would have preferred a leather sheath but the plastic one it comes with is very clever. Plastic is not good for the environment. You can always grow more cows or wood.The only question I have is if the handle well hold up and how easy it is to replace. Fiskar steel is better than average, not as good as say Silky Saw steel or Gransfours Bruk steel which is world class,  but it is as good as Estwing steel or Vaughn steel so it is great steel. This axe has a commercial grade head as far as steel quality. It is a great, great head.I gave it five stars as for the price you can't beat this splitting axe. For the homeowner or non professional  you cant beat this splitting axe and the only shame is that Vaughn or Estwing don't make a splitting maul or heavy splitting axe in the USA. This axe is the bomb as this generation says.The only question is how many 'years' of hard use can you get out of the axe handle for professional splitters. But you could buy 4 of these for the price of the Gransfour  maul and this splits better although Gransfours won't like to hear that. The Granfours of course last several generations the steel quality is so good so if you don't want to have your kids buy tools go with Granfours axes and maul if you can afford them. I inherited my grandfathers gransfour axes and I am an old man now and they still cut/split like they were new.Given what is available in the market for high quality 6-8 pound mauls not made in China or India or the third world  this splitting axe is the best choice for the home owner with a lot of wood to split especially big rounds. It really cracks those big rounds I was using a estwing wedge and 8/10 lb Vaughn sledge to break.Looks like they are selling enough of these I can get a new handle if it breaks and the handle is under warranty but I always misplace receipts. I'm going to put some coffee can tin underneath the head to extend the life of the handle as the head is a 'perfect' design. They should give a raise to the engineer who designed this axe. I will  buy a few more of these.In summary a superbly designed axe with capability to split equal to a good usa made 8 lb maul with near commercial quality ex for the handle and lack of a leather sheath. For the price you can't beat this tool and its made in  Finland where the government respects labor and not China or India nations looking to gut and steal USA and Canadian jobs by rigging their currency and employing child labor.Too bad about the cheap looking plastic sheath. A leather sheath and a commercial grade handle of top quality hickory would make this a forever tool and I would gladly pay $75 dollars or more to get the upgrade to the commercial handle and a good sheath. Gransfour is on the run with this axe at last. Heck I would pay 125 dollars for his head on a commercial grade handle it is that good.Thanks Fiskar. Thanks for providing us with an ethical buying choice and such a superb design. Fix your other tool lines and I will be a buyer. This makes up for all the other Fiskar tools I wore out or the help broke. So Fiskar owed me as I don't take back tools I wear out. That is my job to be a buyer and pay a fair price for high quality.This axe has HIGH QUALITY although its is nothing to look at as far as aesthetics. Only Gransfour makes beautiful axes anymore."

I like the long handle and it works good for someone of my height (6 feet).  I can say this wood splitter has been as good as people say it is and is by far the best wood splitter I have owned.  I used to go though a wood handle on my old wood splitter every year because of wear and tear with an occasional miss of my target.  This wood splitter is far lighter and far more durable.  I have cut about 4 cords of wood with it so far and am very pleased with how it works.As many others point out, you will need to keep this sharp for it to work correctly, and I recommend getting the Fiskars 7861 Axe and Knife Sharpener along with this.  I sharpen it every hour or two of good use.  If I notice the wood isn't splitting well, I sharpen it again (it is easy to loose track of time when splitting wood).  I keep the cover on it at all times when not in use as this is not something you want to fall on anything accidentally.I want to thank everyone here for their insightful reviews, which got me to buy this and to Fiskers for making such a great product.  I have been splitting wood for about 10 years now and I only wish I knew about this product when I first started.  I cannot recommend this product enough!"

The hollow handle cuts down on the weight and the efficient design of the wedge make splitting wood much easier.  I was able to split 3-foot cedar rounds relatively easily after failing to be able to with my old splitting maul.  I use the 36 inch handle, but sometimes choke up a bit to get more force.  This is an excellent design that allows you to split wood more quickly with less effort."

After a little bit of research I decided on the Fiskars X27 with the longer handle. After several days of chopping wood I am a believer. The axe arrived in a timely manner with a sharp edge burrowed safely in the protective, snug fitting head cover.Some of the oak sections left for me are 17-20 inches in diameter, an impossibility for my old axe. With the Fiskars I made quick work of a 17&#34; piece and an 11&#34; log today. In fact with three hits I was able to split the larger log right down the middle. For other pieces instead of hitting in the middle I chopped pieces off of the edges until the log was small enough to split in the middle.I like this new axe quite a bit. It's sturdy, nicely designed aesthetically, and cuts like nothing I've ever used before without needing the strength of Hercules. The Fiskars is just a little longer than my old axe and is just the right length for this 5 foot 10 inche amateur lumberjack. Occasionally I forgot about those few extra inches of length and hit my target with the axe handle. Eventually I learned to stand back just a little further.At first I wondered if any product could live up to so many positive affirmations. This axe does and for me is well worth the money."

Oh, I am also lazy...I got sick and tired of screwing and unscrewing my garden hoses whenever I wanted to swap from nozzle to sprinkler. Much to my delight, I found these years ago when buying a new sprinkler (a Gardena) and haven't been able to do without these since.I have a two-way connector attached to my spigot with a QC (Quick Connector), one side goes to our auto-timer that runs the sprinkler (told you I was a lazy gadget lover!!), and one to the regular cleaning/tasking hose. On the end of my tasking hose is another QC so I can slap on another sprinkler or nozzle with very little effort. Because I have a QC on the spigot as well, I can easily change hose configuration without breaking my back because I'd have to bend over AND twist around to access that one.NOTE: Because these are made of plastic, they do have a limited life - especially if you leave them out all year long. (Been there, done that.)  The summer sun and winter freeze will cause the pieces to crack sometimes, so be sure to check them before you use them at the start of the season.Part of the fun is figuring out which pieces should go to what. Have fun with that.

If the reel is full of hose, that extra weight doesn't help much either.I'm going to try knocking back to just 50 feet of hose instead of the full reel of hose. My experienced guess is that will work  better. Also I'll spray some UV protectant on the hub before I mount the reel. That may help.So why do I keep buying these if they don't last too long? Well, for one I've got my holes drilled in the brick and I really like just being able to slap the new unit in place of the old one without drilling even more holes for some new reel which may or may not last any longer than this one.

Like other reviews I've read, the round parts that are on either side of the wrapped hose were also warped. That means it came from the factory/shipper that way. There was no damage to the shipping box. Perhaps the heat from the sun will help straighten that out. I also read their 5 year warranty, which I doubt I would ever use. The defective one needs to be shipped back to the company at owners expense, they will fix or replace it, then you must pay for return shipping. That is NOT a good or reasonable warranty. Still, I'm satified with my purchase. UPDATE: IT DIDN'T EVEN LAST ONE YEAR. WHILE I LIVE IN ARIZONA WHERE IT'S HOT, THE PLASTIC DRIED OUT AND FRONT PART WITH THE HOSE FELL OFF AFTER BREAKING.

You can buy more from Cameron international or Amazon.com. I use it all the time and never have any problems with smoke filling up the kitchen and the smoke detector never goes off. It's a closed unit so virtually all of the smoke stays inside.  If there is a problem with smoke escaping, the instructions include tips on how to correct the problem.  Usually, the lid just needs a little tweaking.I think the first thing I smoked in it was salmon and let me tell you it was delicious! I have also smoked chicken, turkey wings, sweet potatoes, potatoes, shrimp, burgers, and cheese all with excellent results.  I put the potatoes in the microwave for a few minutes to shorten the cooking time. The chicken doesn't brown as in a traditional outdoor smoker or grill but you can finish cooking it in the oven to brown it.  If it's smoke flavor you are after, this is a very good alternative to outdoor smoking!Cleaning the smoker is a breeze if you first spray the rack with cooking spray.  Also if you line the base of the smoker and the drip pan with aluminum foil all you have to do is let it cool completely and dump the foil in the trash.

I figure that this grill should last you about 5-6 years, with regular use.  I'd definitely recommend it and I'd also suggest buying the cover to keep it looking nice on the outside as well."

It wasn't too difficult to assemble and the parts machining is excellent, everything fit together very well.  I have only 2 problems with this grill.  First, the hangers you attach to the lid to allow you to hang the lid from the side of the grill are quite a pain when placing the lid.  Makes it difficult for the lid to fit snugly.  Not a problem, I'll just take the hangers off as they don't work that well anyway.  Second, I grilled on it 2 days ago, on a fairly calm day weather wise.  For some reason the flame kept going out.  Took me an hour to grill 4 steaks, should have only taken 20 minutes.  Not sure what causes this problem as I haven't ready anyone else experiencing it.  It's annoying enough that it keeps the grill from getting 5 stars."

As others have said, it heats evenly unlike most grills which focus the heat along the burner.The only reason I'm giving it three starts is because Amazon (and the Char Broil) site lists it as having a propane tank included. From reading the Amazon description and some other reviewers comments, it should've come with a smaller propane tank. According to the Char Broil site there should be a 20 pound tank. I sent Amazon an email followed by a phone call, and they stated that there should've been a tank, so they immediately sent me a new grill, had it the next day, great customer service! But this one, like the first box said on the outside \"LP tank not included.\" I called Amazon now, and the rep agreed that there should be a tank, and sending a third unit would be pointless as it would probably not have a tank. Amazon offered me a $30 refund to cover the cost of a 20 pound tank purchased locally, which was an acceptable resolution."

The bags often have defects. This 'type' of bag device is great for flies (get the 'Big Bag' fly type as it stinks more like a ripe out-house and holds lots) but this (YJ type) smells like rotten fish (better to smell bad and catch things that sting you). Get the 'Big Bag Fly Trap' type like this for flies but use Rescue yellow plastic traps for YJ's. (W.H.Y traps are worthless so read the reviews). These will trap some flys and YJ's and a few Hornets going in for live food. Hornets will not fit in the hard yellow Rescue YJ traps, but hornets do fit in these, and do go in after flys and YJ's.Hornets are very unique and there seems to be no attractant for hornets, except people, and other live insects. Stick with Rescue (hard yellow-domed plastic type) for YJ's. This type, made for flies, work 'great' for flies. Hornets seem to hang out at the bag-type fly and yellowjacket traps to capture live insects. Sometimes these traps and the fly traps capture hornets (that is why I switched from 1 to 3 stars) that go in looking for live flys or maggots but it is not real common. I find one hornet hangs out at he top of the trap at a time, and when there is a hornet there the other bugs disappear. When it is gone the other critters reappear. These traps smell like rotten fish, which is fine, and the fly traps smell like outhouses, which is really strong if the wind is wrong. Hard to eat near the fly traps. I have trapped several hornets that go in due to the activity in the bags.Hint: If you add a very little non foaming, non smelling, dish soap to any water-type trap the insects drown quickly instead of crawl out, dehydrate, wear-out, or over-heat. These critters (YJ's and hornets) only know to sting and are constantly hunting for food for their hive, to feed the larvae (more future scavangers). They sting live bugs and bury them in with the growing insect to feed on while they are in suspended animation = creepy).Update 8-7-13:I still think these are not as good as the reusable Rescue hard trap (for yellow jackets) which you can re-bait:Pros:-They do catch flys and some YJ's.-They do trap some hungry Hornets looking for live critters.-It is an attractant for flys, YJ's and Hornets (rotten fish smell and activity)-It comes with attractant; just add water and a lead to hang it with.Cons:-They are firm plastic bags, flexes but not soft like a baggie-type, and some have arrived with holes (punctures) in them, which I used duct (Gorilla) tape on to cover then fill. This can lead to a stinky mess if you fill any in the kitchen. I do not know a way around this type of bag and think 'it is the best they can do' for a bag.-Holes develop on the seams after a while. Maybe from the weight of the water.-You have to keep replenishing the liquid that evaporates (I use a little wine/apple juice/sugar-water with a dab of non-fragrant, non foaming dish soap; do not use hot water).-They are one-use and throw away (before tossing I recommend draining the fluid outdoors, away from the house, letting the bag dry out, then throw away in the trash - stinky mess with maggots from flys). I do not recommend just putting a smelly liquid-maggot-filled bag in your trash.-Many yellow jackets tend to walk-in and walk-out, as do hornets and flys.-Stationed at most bags there is a sentry Hornet that posts itself at the entrance and it keeps all YJ's and flys away. Hornets prefer live catch. Other flying insects seem to be afraid of them, and I have seen some Hornets try to sting a bug (from the outside of the bag) that is inside the bag, and they try to catch any that fly around. This problem tends to keep many flys and YJ's away from this type of trap.-I have seen Hornets stationed at the 'fly traps', too, but I have trapped many flys in them so they get 5 stars. I have seen Hornets go in and sting maggots but have not witnessed them flying out with them, not that they don't.-these do not come with a hanging device (so be sure you have one on before you fill it).-you must carefully cut the bag with scissors around the opening to pull out the entrance device before filling and hanging."

I was prepared to try to catch queens early and hopefully have a better summer - typically bugs of any kind are not an issue here.When I bought the non disposable, I  also bought these and these are not only lots more convenient but I've been getting 50-75 in each in several days vs 15-20 in the non disposable.  Our weather typically is a string of warm, sunny days followed by cool & cloudy so at the onset of warm and sunny, I set out fresh traps.I have 8 acres of wooded property but am setting traps only in my yard area - maybe slightly less than 1 acre.  I didn't expect to catch so many this early.  I hope it helps.Now - in my area, they seem to do best in the sun.  It is nearly 80 today but most warm days have been 65-70.  I have 2 or 3  of a mix of disposable and non-disposable hung in 5 places from 20-40 feet away from my house.I'm using water in the traps, not apple juice.FWIW, I did try adding some of my mason jar meat traps and there was no interest in those at this point.  Also, previous years, I've caught wasps and hornets in beer.  Beer did not work last year or this for the YJs.

There is usually a sentry hornet that hangs out at the opening, and tries to get fly's from outside the bag, or, goes in after them. Once that hornet is gone, another arrives. Hornets want live bait.Warning: Do not use indoors!! If you fill it in the kitchen or inside your house, do not spill any in the sink, floor, trash, or your hands, as it really reeks, as it is supposed to to attract fly's, like to an outhouse. Some bags do leak from manufacturing defects. Yuck!! It does not wash off easily. Do not use warm or hot water in the bags as you will dissolve the smelly contents too quickly and not attract fly's to the heat. Once hung, refill it, regularly only to the line (it gives them space to crawl in and get stuck inside), and towards the end of the season add some apple-juice to attract more flys and hornets, and yellow jackets. Adding a drop of dish detergent helps them drown quickly, and to sink to the bottom. If you fill it too full, or the dead fly's stack up, the others will crawl out easily. Keep a space between the yellow plastic and the fly's and water. Once full of fly's just unhook it and set it on the ground to dry out then toss the whole bag; it will stink. Be sure once you have opened it that the yellow top seals in the open position from the weight so fly's do not crawl back out. Be careful not to get stung while refilling if a stinger creature is close; you encroach on their hunting territory.These have worked well for me and I prefer The Big Bag model. Highly recommended!!

After the first day, and during the hot ones, trust me, it will be gross, yet amazing thing what this trap can do.Second, you have to constantly add water to the level indicated on the bag, specially during the hot days and if the trap is under direct sun light. This is easy to do with a paper cup or any other small cup.Third, when hanging it, place it away from your doors and windows, or be ready for some nasty smells. The trap has a mixture of eggs(dried) and other products to create a strong odor that flies can't resist.In conclusion, this product DOES NOT USE chemicals at all, it is all natural and catches a great number of fly species; it won't let you down.

We have a heat wave at this time and during the hottest part of the day I did not see any flies around the unit. Today I am going to hang it in a shade tree. I'm sure that will work and if it does not I will update this review within a short period of time.I feel that this trap is well worth what I paid for it and as soon as I am done with this review I am going to order at least one more maybe two. One for the front yard and one for the back. I have a fly problem because I have fruit trees, compost piles, a garden, and I live in a tiny town surrounded by farms. The flies in the front yard are a bad problem because when I mow the yard they come out and pester me when I am trying to concentrate on safely mowing the part of my yard where it has steep slopes. You can easily turn your mower over while trying to swat a biting fly. If the yard does not get mowed I wind up with thousands of mosquitoes and dozens of snakes.All in all I am happy with this purchase and I wish I had found this item many years sooner.UPDATE. JULY 28,2011.I'm glad I ordered more. My trap is already full. One more thing I need to mention. Don't hang the bag too close to where you sit or eat outside. The bag has an odor and without that odor the trap will not work. I would experiment by hanging it in different locations. The perfect spot would be close enough to attract flies away from you but far enough that you don't smell it. It also helps to remove things that attract flies away from the trap. Mine hangs in a fruit tree. I had some rotten fruit on the ground that was attracting the flies more than the trap. I raked them up and got rid of them. The next day the flies were swarming the trap even more than they had been."

It is a little heavy for me when fully extended but not so bad I can't use it.  One thing I learned is to adjust the head so I make square cuts to avoid any hang up from the branch starting to fall and binding the blades.  Used this to trim limbs over my electric pasture fence while driving my tractor so my Tractor ROPS bar now clears the limbs. If the jaws fit around a limb you can cut it without a terrible amount of strength.  I bought this to trim some tall hedge bushes along the edge of my yard and it worked well for trimming the tall tops.  Have used the saw (3 inch limbs) and it cuts fine if you let it do the cutting and take your time.  Used it to cut some woody stemed large weeds on hard to navigate banks too. Over all a very handy tool."

My husband loves it and thinks the construction is superior.  Unfortunately, I have difficulty working it.  He's 65, and I'm 59 and don't have the arm strength/length nor the the height (5' 3\" and under are going to have trouble) to work it properly when it needs to be fully extended. Any man should have no difficulty, and it will pay for itself the first time you use it versus hiring someone to prune for you.August 30, 2007 update:  Since December 2006 when I bought this, I have been forced to use this more because my husband has been unavailable due to his golfing addiction.  In spite of my shortness, this tool works fine for me as long as the trunk of what you are cutting isn't more than one and one-half inch in diameter.  However, there is a saw attachment which will allow you to get through the thicker branches.  Over time, this tool has become indispensable to me, especially since I have six redwood trees, numerous other treees, and tons of high bushes.August 16, 2011:  Fiskars has terrific customer service.  After almost five years of heavy use, a plastic clamp that holds the extension, broke.  Know that Fiskars honors a limited lifetime warranty on this item.  I had to send them a copy of my Amazon receipt and a picture of the damage (picture cannot exceed 2 megabytes). Full instructions on how to make a warranty claim are included on Fiskars' website, plus their telephone customer service is excellent.  They sent me a new part plus a link to complete instructions, including pictures, for disassembling the pruner and replacing the part.  My husband was able to effect the repair.  There was no dollar cost to me at all, and this is way better than having to buy another one for $80.May 28, 2014:  I still use this pruner regularly, and it continues to work well after the repair.  The only problem is that you do have to watch the thickness of the branches you are cutting because this pruner will only tolerate so much."

I do agree that there should be a box long enough for the item to fit in.  The pole is solid enough that there was very little chance of damage.

        "text": "I have only owned a couple smokers in my life, and after purchasing this one - I don't plan on owning anything else. The Weber Smokey Mountain Cooker (WSM) is a simple, yet incredibly effective water smoker.The WSM has two cooking sections which allows you to smoke a good amount of food (such as a whole turkey and a whole ham simultaneously). The 18 1/2 inch grates allow plenty of food, but you might have to get a little tricky if you want to smoke something like 8 racks of ribs. This can be done if you roll the ribs up and use a skewer to hold them in place. If you aren't trying to entertain large parties, then this is the perfect family smoker.The WSM is coated with porcelain enamel, much like the One-Touch kettle grills. The grates are triple-nickel-plated. The WSM is very sturdy. The material is nice and hefty, you don't get the sense that this smoker was cheaply made. One of the only issues I have with this smoker is the access door. Instead of being hinged it comes completely off the smoker. It can take a little bit of figiting to get it to attach to the smoker, but this is an extremely small issue.The reason people love this smoker is because with a single batch of charcoal you can smoke for an incredibly long time. If you use the minion method then you can smoke for up to 18-20 hours without adding anymore charcoal! For those who aren't aware, the minion method is where you fill the charcoal ring with unlit charcoal, light about 10-15 briquettes and place them on top of the unlit charcoal. Please don't use the minion method with pre-soaked coals. My first smoke was a brisket and for the first 5 hours it stayed exactly at 245 degrees without any adjustments! I thought my thermometer was broken... it wasn't - this smoker is incredibly efficient. Another example is the second time I smoked with this. I smoked a 10 lb brisket, started at midnight. It finished 5:00 PM the following day. That's 17 hours right there. I roused the coals a bit and was able to smoke some stuffed jalapenos for another 2 hours. That's 19 hours on a single batch of charcoal! I am very impressed. I have a Brinkman smoker and when I used that smoker I would get about 2 hours of burn time. The WSM is just so much more efficient and has MUCH better air control.Here are a couple of tips if you plan on buying a WSM (and you should!).Get a decent enough thermometer, such as a candy thermometer so you can check your temperature at the lid. This will become instrumental in your cooking.Unfortunately the WSM has a small water pan. What you should do is buy a replacement Brinkmann Smoke N Grill charcoal pan (don't get the water pan, make sure you get the charcoal pan). You can buy one directly from Brinkmann for about $13.00. If you look hard enough you can find them online for around $5.00 - $10.00. The Brinkmann charcoal pan fits perfectly inside the WSM as a water pan (some say it fits even better!). It also holds more then double the amount of water then the standard WSM water pan. This allows you about 7-8 hours of cooking before needing to refill the pan, which is much better then the 2-3 you get with the standard water pan. Once your temps stabilize you can easily do overnight cooks and also get some shut-eye!To conclude I would like to say that if you are even thinking about getting a  vertical water smoker then stop looking right now. This smoker is near perfect in every single way. With a few tiny modifications you can own one of the best smokers in the world at this price!"

Yes, it stinks and it's expensive and it can ruin the taste of your meal if you don't let the charcoal burn down for a long time but it worked every time.  Those Brand X chimney starters didn't always get the charcoal going.The Weber is larger and the design is well thought-out.  Instead of a few holes in the bottom of the charcoal section, it has a grate.  And the grate is kind of reverse-cone shaped so more charcoal comes in contact with the burning newspaper.  The result--it lights pretty much perfectly every time.  All it takes is two broadsheet pages of newpaper stuffed in the bottom.  That's two broadsheets--the equivalent of eight pages of your morning newspaer.  You can also use paper towels--they create less ash.  If you want, you can lightly spray the newpaper or towels with a little Pam or the like.  That's gets the paper to burning quickly.Don't bother with those small, poorly designed, no-name (or even big-name) chimney starters you see around.  The Weber is the one to get."

It takes years to rust through. My old one lasted about 5-6 years.3. It will rust like any steel exposed to high heat, so the thicker the metal, the longer it will last.4. The length of time to start the coals depends on the brand of coals, their moisture content, humidity and the way you crumple up the newspaper.5. If the coals fail to catch, then repeat the process. Do not pour lighter fluid into it. Doo.6. I just grab the insulated handle and pour the coals out. I do not use the tipping handle thing so I don't need gloves.7. One of the features of a Weber, and some other grills, is that after you finish grilling, you can shut off the vents and save some of the coals for next time. So, pile the newly lit coals over the old ones. This lights them up and gives you a longer fire as well.8. Weber offers little wire fences that allow you to keep the coals off to one side of the grill. Use this feature. Pour your coals into this area, sear your meat quickly and then move it off to the non-coaled area and put the lid on and let it cook slowly to completion. Add specialty wood chips at this time if you wish. This gives the best result.9. Weber stuff seems to be the best, at least in its price range, and they offer a lot of quality accessories that are properly designed.10.

You really need to have 2 of them when doing large meats such as turkey's and half pigs. That way you can start enough charcoal right off the bat. It also says that you should wait until the coals have a slight white ash on them. I would have to disagree with that because the coals are 30 min from being burned up by then. I wait until the center is red hot and flames are leaping from the top. It seems the coals last longer that way. for 15 bucks it's a no-brainer. Get it!"

        "text": "Like many other charcoal barbeque enthusiasts, I hate using charcoal lighter fluid.  (Who wants toxic junk smoldering all over their food?)  For years I have used an electric lighter, but ours was on its last legs.  I was tempted to buy a gas grill, as they are fast-lighting, but just really didn't want to spend the money on a product that doesn't perform the way I like.  So, based on the favorable reviews, I decided to try the Weber Chimney Starter.Wow.  Really.I was accustomed to putting the electric lighter under the coals, and preparing other parts of the dinner while the coals were getting started.  And after they had gotten started, it took a while for the fire to really get rolling.I use a Weber barbeque, and every time after I have finished grilling, I close down the vents and save the briquets for another use.  I only have to add a couple of handfuls of new briquets each time I cook.I stuffed the bottom of the Weber chimney starter with newspaper as directed, put in the cold leftover briquets from the last grilling session, and added the usual amount of new briquets.  I lit the newspaper as directed.  At first all it seemed to be doing was producing a copious amount of smoke.  I walked away, and came back just a few minutes later to find the charcoal flaming away most impressively.  The coals were ready in about a quarter of the time that it took using the electric starter.Who needs a gas barbeque for a fast-starting fire?  I had my whole dinner cooked in a half hour from the time that I lit the newspaper.  This charcoal starter is a gem!Update (June 29, 2008):  After using this starter for almost a year (yes, I barbeque in the winter) I have a couple of notes to add.  First, use only the amount of newspaper recommended.  More newspaper cuts down the amount of air able to circulate through the fire, and you just end up with a smoldering mess.  Secondly, don't fill the container full of charcoal.  Doing so extends the time it takes for all the charcoal to ignite, with the end result of making the handle too hot to comfortably hold.  Even if you need a lot of charcoal, only fill the container half-full. Once the briquets are burning, dump them into the barbeque and put more briquets right on top of them if you need more."

I use natural charcoal exclusively (you know, real wood, not gravel and clay briquettes), and this works perfectly with that kind of charcoal.You'll reduce the amount of time necessary to get a usable fire, and you won't have that annoying starter fluid smell or taste on your food.Two caveats to consider: this thing gets very hot by its nature, so use oven mitts when grabbing the handle, and be careful where you put it after dumping the coals, so as to keep small children and yourself from touching it until it cools."

I have always used lighter fluid and was notorious for using to much because the charcoal wouldn't light fast enough.  That problem is solved with this chimney starter.  The coals ignite quickly and a full blaze is going within minutes!  Once the flames have died down, just dump them out and start grilling!I have the Performer grill but when I bought the grill, the store didn't have any cartridges so I have been using the chimney starter all summer.  So it's a nice backup if you have the Performer but no gas cartridge.This is a good product for the price."

Simply add charcoal to rim of chimney, place parafin lighters or newspaper in the bottom. Light newspaper or parrafin lighters and place on charcoal grate in grill.  In 20-30 minutes you will have orange hot smokin' charcoal.This is also a must for cooking things with very long cooking times such as turkeys or roasts.  About 30 minutes before adding additional charcoal, use this puppy to light your coals, and then add to the fire as needed.As I mentioned earlier, I reccomend using this in conjunction with the Weber parrafin charcoal lighters.  On windy days they are easier to use than newspaper.Once you use this you will never go back to using lighter fluid again.  A must have for anyone who owns a charcoal grill."

The charcoal just wasn't getting hot enough to burn it all off, especially on cold, rainy days. By the time the ligher fluid was burned-off, the coals were nearly gone, too.We had just seen Alton Brown's Good Eats episode, The Grill Seakers. He had used a chiminy starter to get his charcoal going, so when we saw one in the store, my wife told me to buy it and try it.Well, after two years of use, that cheap starter has gotten to the point where it's ready to fall apart. I needed a new one, and I needed to add something inexpensive to my Amazon.com order to qualify for free shipping, so I ordered this one.I've got to say, even though I read the reviews, I just wasn't expecting something so big! This thing has half-again as much capacity as my old one. It's also a heavier guage metal, and a better handle.One hint: I lightly spray my newspaper with corn oil before putting it in the chiminey. It never burns away too fast, as just two sheets can do if there's enough wind, and I don't find myself packing too much newspaper in. I always get a good fire going, with no lighter fluid taste."

        "text": "The other reviews are correct. This unit works very well in every way, a basket mesh kind of food holder would be a good option, use a drip pan and keep the coals off to the sides, the ring riser/extension is useful for smoking and cooking big things, etc. It is all good, but there is more:Who do you know who actually has a charcoal grill and a rotisserie? Nobody. If you get one, your guests will be entertained on several levels and you will be the Master. A rotisseries is professional looking, produces unmatched taste and an exciting demonstration-style cooking experience for everyone. Those that utilize them are seen as proficient and competent. Not a bad label for you, eh? Might get you somewhere.The best meal I ever had was a rotisserie turkey that saved me from starvation after a Hike of Death. Perhaps it can save you or a loved one.Rotisserie cooking lends itself to the acclaimed high heat, short cooking time technique. Hot coals and the self-basting action work well here. One of the major gourmet magazines cooked turkeys every way known and strongly recommended the high heat way. This is also the suggested method for cooking heritage meats and wild game.Starting out at 500+ degrees and ending at something short of US government temperature recommendations is the secret. A turkey, for example, is best taken out of the heat at around 170, or less, and allowed to rest. It will go up around 10 degrees after that.I tie bacon strips onto the breast and add wet smoking wood chips to the coals. Stuff the cavity with an orange and some garlic. Other things could be used, too. I have rotisseried heritage, free range, organic, kosher and regular good quality supermart turkeys with this high-heat method and they have all been good.Governments and institutions have to recommend a heat guaranteed to kill off any and everything, and prevent lawsuits of course. However, fresh good quality meat does not have to be nuked to the point where you could make furniture out of it. Use a separate thermometer, not the supplied pop-out sensor. I am no professional, but I can say it produces the best tasting food.___________________________________UPDATE: Years later, it still works. Here are some things that will help you if you get one of these. First, for a turkey, get two oranges and stick them in the cavities. Then, stick the skewer through them. This keeps the turkey from wobbling around so much as the oranges act like bearings. Also, get some meat wrapping string and spend the time it takes to tie the legs, tail and wings up to the skewer so that the turkey is more like a ball without all sorts of dangling things flopping around. Use lots of string. It is cheap. Know that all the energy of the universe will try to circumvent your efforts, so over-do it with the string. Cut it off with scissors before serving.Coat the turkey with olive oil. Don't baste it again.Obviously, don't stuff it!I don't use the bacon anymore. If you use the temperature recommendations, you won't miss the bacon.  It was a pain to tie on and was kind of a waste.The Polder remote thermometer is nice because the probe is thin and doesn't create a big hole.I stop at 160 degrees now. That's just me. Remember, you can cook it more, but you can't remove the overcooking.Learn how to cut the breast meat off. Don't slice it off while it is on the turkey. Instead, cut down right alongside that breastbone. Then cut in from the side, about half-way down the side, straight in. This gives you a big chunk from that one side.  On a plate, cut it in slices, across it, across the grain. So much more professional and better in every way. And it is easier. If you are having trouble visualizing this, you can google up a demo video or illustration.I saw a TV show where it was demonstrated that soaking the chips makes no difference, so I don't anymore. A couple of handfuls gives a nice, not overwhelming little smoke flavor. You may want more, or none.The Weber a fine device and one that surely will make you the rockstar of turkey cooking. Imagine how pathetic your relatives will seem when they take their sad turkeys out of the oven after hours of worthless basting. There will be murmuring and eye-rolling from those who remember yours. Make sure you tell the others, loudly, how you just sit around drinking while your turkey rotates effortlessly around, cooking perfectly. By the time the hosts are finished with excuses as to why their turkey sucks, again, you will be elevated to near rock-god status. Humiliation is an essential part of any family holiday and you want to be the one doing the humiliation.See the review of the Weber chimney charcoal starter for a good tip on that."

It always comes out great, except for the one time my Beagle chased a deer into the woods and I had to go after her.  I got back about thirty minutes later and my chicken was ruined.  I actually ended up feeding it to my Beagle, so now I am thinking maybe she did it on purpose?  They are pretty smart.  And chasing a deer had to be a ruse to distract me, I mean seriously, what was she going to do if she actually caught the deer?The rotisserie chickens I have cooked so far have turned out much, much better than all the other ways I have cooked chicken over charcoal. And I have cooked chicken a lot of different ways.I have read that rotisseries are self-basting because most of the juices don't drip, they just kind of roll around over the chicken.  Maybe.  But all I know is as long as I take the bird off at around 165 degrees, cover it for about ten minutes, then serve it, it always comes out fantastic.If you have one of these you know what I am talking about.  If you don't, you should get one, you will like it.This is not just for chicken or turkey.  I cooked a chuck roast to slightly over rare and then sliced it up for some excellent roast beef."

Well, I finally tried one, and oh, my God!!!! It was AWESOME!!! The taste was like no other rotisserie Chicken that I have ever eaten!! I cooked it slow, about 3 hours, starting with about 12 coals on each side, using the indirect cooking method. I added more coals every hour to keep the temperature about the same (about 325-350). I experimented with basting it with Beer when I added more coals. I also added soaked hickory wood chips with the coals each time. To die for!!!  I also tried a Pork roast. The same awesome results were obtained. Next I will try a Turkey. I am totally sold on this item, and highly recommend it to anyone who owns a Weber 22-1/2\" kettle grill.

There is the skewer with the two prongs that slide over and screw onto it to hold your meat in place.  There is a big ring that sits on top of your kettle and the lid goes on that.  There's a screw-on counterweight to help with even rotation.  And then the motor that slides onto a bracket on the aforementioned ring.  That's it.  Basically no assembly required.  Do you like beer can chicken?  You won't bother after using this.  I'm not a chef so I can't explain how spinning the meat around makes it so good but it does.  Juiciest bird ever, seriously.  Also does roasts well with excellent results too.  I haven't used this for a turkey but I can't see how that wouldn't be outstanding as well.  The motor is quiet, if you care about that kind of thing.  The plug attached to it is ridiculously short so you will probably need an extension cord.  I recommend keeping the box it comes in for storage because otherwise it's kind of bulky and random in the garage.  The only criticism is it's expensive.  But it's one of the coolest BBQ things i own and would buy another in a heartbeat if it was stolen or broken.  But Weber doesn't make them anymore!  So if you are thinking about this, buy now before they are gone forever.  I wish I could get extra prongs for the skewer so I could do two of whatever I am doing without have to jerry-rig it."

Having an infant crawling around, I was really hesitant about spraying Roundup and having that leeching into the soil, not to mention, our property borders a creek. I ordered this and had it the next day! Hooked it up and immediately began flame throwing. Thankfully, I began in the middle of our brick patio. This baby kicks out quite a flame. It was a breezy day, I suggest using this when there is little to no wind. It doesn't produce a tight concentrated flame like a propane soldering torch for plumbing would.Honestly I almost canceled the order in lieu of the $28 model from Harbor Freight. Thankfully you can't yet do that on an iPod touch or mobile phone. The more I thought about it, do I really want to trust an inferior tool when I am dealing with 100,000 BTU?Do keep a fire extinguisher or hose on hand! I did this the day after a rainstorm, which I'd suggest. Do NOT do it when it is dry outside. Even so, the grass caught on fire a couple of times.Next task.... I have a carpenter ant hill right where the sand box is supposed to go. No need to pesticides, I'll turn the ground and flame away. Not even summer yet, and I can't wait to try this on the ice in the driveway!"

I have a gravel driveway - what a pain to use Roundup to kill the little grasses and weeds sprouting in the spring; it doesn't take much to fry them plus, on a cold day, the gravel gets warmed by the torch so my feet stay toasty.  I was initially concerned about lugging around the big propane tank on my dolly - not a hassle at all, the torch extends about 10 feet out so a big area can be covered.  Just be careful with dry grass - it catches on fire easily so keep an eye out for persistent flames.  Otherwise, a big time-saver - I wish I had some snow or ice to melt."

        "text": "Just about everybody over the age of thirty has some kind of issue with knee and/or back pain, esp. when you want to do seasonal clean-ups inside or out.I was kind of flabbergasted when I was on my hands and knees, cleaning the bathroom floor, and my knees...hurt!...just from kneeling on the tile. I bought this device to help with that chore, and it's a lifesaver. It's made for outdoor use (and it's one of the sturdiest things I've ever bought), but for me it's been wonderful for indoor cleaning.The reviews here are excellent, so I don't want to reinvent that wheel. There are just two things I'd add from my own observations; that is, things you might not know until you actually order and get this kneeler.First of all, the yellow pad is on both sides, it's not just padded one one side. Now as it's show in this picture, it's something to sit on. If you burn it upside down so the yellow pads are a few inches off the floor, behold! It's a kneeler! The metal \"arms\" that become long when you flip it over are extremely sturdy. If you have problems working on the floor and getting up, they'll hold your weight easily and make getting off the floor a breeze (you don't even have to be kneeling ON it to use it as a sturdy prop to stand up.)The other thing is that the device is folded up when you get it. To use it, you just open one \"leg,\" then the other. Some folks seem to have problems folding it back up (very easy to store.) To do this, look for the springs on each side. There is a metal bar that runs perpendicular to the springs. Grasp the bar AND the spring section and squeeze. It's very resilient. You don't have to force the two bars together, but just enough to loosen the knobs that click into place when you open the device. When you squeeze (and yes, it's a bit hard if you're a woman), push the arm down, and one half is folded. Do the same with the other side, and you're done. (To open it, just open each arm. It locks into place with no effort.)You don't have to be an AARP member to find this device to be incredibly useful. I bought two: one for indoors and one for outside stuff. I absolutely recommend it if you find that your glucosamine and chondroitin tablets are taking awhile to kick in with that knee pain!"

        "text": "This is a study feeder, with a tube 4.5\" in diameter.  The seed comes out the bottom of the tube into a small tray that goes around the tube.  The birds can feed through 4 holes in a metal sleeve that is suspended by a spring from the bottom of the tube.The main selling points on bird feeders seems to be 1) How squirrel-proof is it, 2) how long will it last, and 3) how much does it cost?  I will add a 4th of my own requirements, and that is how deer-proof is it.  I have had deer come in Winter and tilt myPerky-Pet 7103-2 Copper Triple Tube Bird Feederfeeder and drain the whole thing in a night.  The hoof-prints in the snow gave them away.  ;-)So this feeder appears to be both squirrel- and deer-proof.  Tilting the feeder does lose some seed, but it does not flow out very easily, especially when the bottom part is pulled down like when a squirrel or deer is trying to get into it.  The top dome also tilts when weight is on it, which will certainly cause squirrels and chipmunks to slide off.  I think it's a good design.How long will it last?  They claim a heavy-duty, powder coated finish, which I assume is over standard steel.  The spring inside the bottom part to make it tilt I assume is steel as well.  So this feeder will likely rust in maybe 5+ years, and once the spring rusts away, the bottom will fall off the tube - the spring is the only thing holding it on.  You will have to get a new spring from Perky Pet.  Aluminum or stainless steel would be better materials.How much does it cost?  This feed is on the expensive side, especially not knowing what materials it's made of and how long it will last.  I would wait for a price-reduction from the list price."

        "text": "As a serious bird enthusiast, I have a fairly elaborate setup to attract them and have many.  This feeder seemed a good addition, but there are problems.  To begin with, when it arrived the black cap that covers the spring mechanism in the interior bottom of the feeder was loose in the box.  I don't think it was supposed to be as the directions didn't mention it and it was quite hard to reattach.  The feeder is really big, but not big enough for me to get my arm all the way down inside it to replace this part.  I finally got it placed by using a reacher/grabber gadget, but couldn't get it pushed down firmly.  As a result I expect problems sooner or later.  Right now it's working, though.The directions did show how to attach the pieces of the top, but I found it annoying that you can't set the feeder down with both the lid and the dome pieces attached as they come apart.  I figured out that the dome shaped cover piece is supposed to stay hung at the location you've chosen and only the tube with its lid is to be removed from the underside hook for refilling.Regarding the refilling:  On the good side, the big open tube is easy to fill with most scoops and can accommodate a wide mouth funnel that further speeds filling and minimizes spilled seed.  On the down side, detaching and reattaching the lid is awkward since the tiny side wires of the lid have to fit into equally tiny holes pierced in the tube, and which aren't easily visible since they are slightly recessed under the lid.  You have to squeeze the tube a bit to make it wide enough for the pins to get inside, then releasing it lets them seat if you have them in the correct position.  These holes are very near the top of the tube and should they break when the plastic is hard, during the winter, for example, the whole feeder becomes useless.  The whole weight of this feeder hangs on the two little holes in the plastic which are only about \" from the top of the tube. Only time will tell how long the feeder lasts and given the fact that one assumes squirrels will be jumping on it, trying to get at the seed, I have concerns.Another issue I have with the feeder is that the perches are very short.  So far only the tiniest birds have been able to feed from it, the chickadees and wrens.  Others may get the hang of it and I put the best no mess seed in it to encourage them.  I'll just have to wait and see.I have several feeders, all of which are very sturdy and need to be. For one thing, they can easily tip over on the uneven gravel where I fill them, which I have to do as often every other day during heavy feeding times.  They are almost never without many birds vying for the best perch and suffer regular attacks from crows and squirrels.  Both these marauders mostly enjoyed the tray feeder as all the others are tube feeders and squirrel proof (not that they don't get worked over).  I hated to have to remove the tray as some of the birds I most prize seeing prefer it, but the crows and squirrels drive me nuts.  So far this feeder has deterred both, which is a definite plus.Considering how expensive this feeder is, I expect it to do a good job at both satisfying my birds and deterring squirrels--and it has to last a long time.  I'll update after an extended trial period.  I've only had it up a week at this point.  Maybe it will grow on me.Update 9/18/13:  I left my other feeders empty for a while so the birds would work harder to use this one and the finches and titmice have decided it's okay.  The bigger birds still can't get purchase, but at least it's useful for the smaller ones.  It was easy to refill.  I feel a bit more positive toward it at this point.Update 10/12/13: Not feeling so positive anymore as the top broke off while refilling today making the feeder essentially useless because you can't rehang it.  Some super glue might work to reattach the hanging wire to the lid."

On the upside, it was easy to assemble. I was interested as to where it was made, it says its made in the USA of US and CHINA parts. Draw your own conclusions."

The nut holding the hook together seems to be too small and threaded incorrectly, but it appears to be holding together fairly well none-the-less.Squirrels still mange to use this product as their very own buffet, but they are not able to chow down as fast on the sun flower seeds I fill it with as they can with some other feeders. That is saving me from having to re-fill this as fast as I have had to fill some other supposedly \"squirrel proof feeders\".The mechanism on the bottom where the food come out is very clever in that it tilts and provides no way for the squirrel to hang on for more than a few moments before dropping to the ground. I am sure that given enough time, the squirrels will find a way to bypass this.What bothers me is the price. This is a fairly high end product for what it is.

After a month one of the perches somehow unscrewed itself and fell off.  I recovered the perch and the nut but could not find the locking washer.  If the locking washer was never there, that would readily explain how the perch came off, and when I checked the other three they were still tight.  So it might be worth a couple of minutes of your time checking that all four perches are screwed in tight when you first unpack it."

During that time only one house finch ate from the feeder, only once. The design is not one that readily attracts birds. They have to discover where it is the feed is offered. It's almost hidden unless they actually perch. They don't want to do that.Other feeders with a mesh feed reservoir nearby were super actively being used at the same time this new feeder was ignored. So if it's called a bird feeder and the birds don't like the design, then that's a giant multi-star negative. I can't recommend this feeder over the other styles, even though it is strong enough to discourage the bushy tails. Less expensive feeders are not squirrel detracting, but for the price, perhaps could be replaced once or twice at a lesser price. And they will allow you to watch birds actually eating seeds.Bottom line: keep looking. I really wanted this feeder to work, but it will not be used much longer.

I've had it up or a long time now and it is surrounded by four other feeders that all do a brisk business. This feeder has the same seed and yet the birds try it once and then ignore it. I'm convinced the seed is simply too difficult to extract and so the bird give up. There are much better feeders on the market and I would start with any feeder from Droll Yankee such asDroll Yankees YF Flipper 4-Port Hanging Bird Feeder. Updated on 1/24/2014.I have a large \"feeder station\" outside of a picture window in my den and over the years I've tried a lot of feeder designs--some just because I was looking for the best made and best designed feeders and some because I wanted to defeat squirrels. I'm in Connecticut and there are lots of gray squirrels here and they are amazingly clever (and funny) when it comes to getting food from a bird feeder. And they are determined little creatures. I finally found a method to keep squirrels out of my feeders 100% of the time, and I'll get to that at the end of this review. But I'm still willing to try new ideas and it would be fun to find a feeder that solves the squirrel issue all on its own. I'm not sure that this feeder does that, but time will tell.This is a larger feeder than I thought it was going to be-and that's a pleasant surprise.  It also seems pretty well made, but I have some doubts about some of its construction features. Here are some pros & cons:Pros:*The dome on top and the lid look as though they'll keep the food dry from rain or snow entering through the top of the feeder. Wet food can grow mold and that is very dangerous to birds.*As I said it's a large-capacity feeder and  holds three pounds of seed. That's pretty substantial, so I like that feature.*It was simple to assemble, all that  you really have to do is attach the lid at the top of the tube and then put the hanging loop (using a small nut) on the dome. Took less than two minutes to assemble everything. Unlike the Droll Yankee feeders that I use, the perches were already installed and that saves time. On many of the Droll Yankee feeders you have to tap them through holes in the plastic tube and that requires freezing the posts (to shrink them) and that's a pain.*Overall it seems very well made, but with a bird feeder it often takes months and some severe weather to find its flaws--so I'll update this review in a month or so.Cons:*First and foremost, I am not crazy about the way the base tilts down. The idea is that the squirrel will fall off (from its own weight tilting the base) but it appears to me that a squirrel could catch its paw in the feeding station opening if the base starts to tilt after he's on the feeder. I'm not completely sure that that's a possibility, but I was able to get my finger caught (gently) between the moving base and the stationery feeding tray. I certainly don't want to look out and see a squirrel hanging by its paw. Again, the risk may be pretty low, but the way this is designed, the feeding perches are attached to a collar (that has holes through which the birds feed off of an interior tray) and that's what moves. It's easier to understand once you have the feeder in front of you.*Also, I prefer a feeder that has a catch tray underneath to catch the spilled seed. Instead, this tray has openings in the base so that food that falls off of the internal feeding tray falls out through slots in the bottom of the feeder (again, much easier to see when you have the feed in front of you).  The problem with food falling on the ground is that it brings rats and mice. When there is a catch try, the food gets eaten by the birds.*The tube seems a bit too flexible to me. The way that you mount the lid, for example, is to squeeze it a bit and slide in two prongs on the lid (the lid, not the dome, they are two separate things). It seems to me like the prongs could have been a tiny bit longer to keep it attached more securely--and also, every time you grab the tube, you squeeze it and the lid can pop off. Not a major flaw, it's minor, but it's an issue. The Droll Yankee feeders have a lid that slides up and down, you don't have to remove it and it fits very securely. I'm not sure if the plastic tube on a Yankee feeder is thicker or not, they may be exactly the same.You might think that from the cons that I don't like this feeder, but that's not quite true. I am willing to keep it up for a while and see how it works, both in keeping squirrels away and in just feeding the birds. If I don't see squirrels hanging by their paws or find a lot of food on the ground, I'll be satisfied. As I said, I like the capacity and I think overall the feeder is made of quality materials. I just have some issues with design choices that had to be made in order to facilitate that tilting base. I will raise my review to four or five stars if the feeder proves itself. I really want to like this feeder partly because I like the capacity so much.OK, I said that I figured out how to keep squirrels off of your feeders and I have. I went to a bird feeding store and I bought a sort of kit that consists of a pole (plus a simple insert for putting the pole in the ground securely--it works beautifully) and a baffle that goes around the pole. Squirrels can only jump about 4' off the ground maximum--and I can verify that from years of playing with the height of the baffle. So if you place the baffle on the pole at 4' or so and IF there are no nearby trees or fences for them to jump from, they simply can't get up the pole. I have a three-pronged hanger at the top of the feeder and I have three feeders on it: sunflower, suet and thistle. It works: in five years, not a single squirrel has reached the promised land.I don't have this Perky-Pet feeder on that pole though because I want to see if it defeats the squirrels on its own. So I just hung it on a 4' pole (a shepherd's hook) so that the base of the feeder is within the squirrel's jumping range. It's only been out a few days and the squirrels haven't discovered it yet, but they will--and soon. I'll try to keep a video camera handy and I'll post a short video of my experiment if I catch a squirrel in action.I love squirrels, I find them very interesting--but I would much rather just watch birds without that extra havoc. I'll post an update shortly."

It has been about a summer month and I am actually surprised to say that we have not seen them eating out of this one.  We have seen them look and survey but we have not seen them even try to get on this one.  So far it has worked well to keep the squirrels at bay.  The two downsides to this feeder are that there are only four posts/holes for the birds to get to the seed so only one or maybe two birds will eat at one time.  The other downside is the ridiculous price.  At over 70 dollars one might as well invite the birds out to dinner and a movie.  I can't imagine how the manufacturer can justify the price for this thing.  The top and bottom are metal but the tube is just thin plastic.

I hung several of the birdhouse style feeders and in no time the squirrels and chipmunks figured out how to scare the birds away and skillfully scatter their meal on the ground. I watched some even work in tandem to steal the bird food.Perky-Pet has recently released their latest in a line of anti-squirrel bird feeders. They call this one the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone: The Baffler (Model 397). If you have ever observed a rodent at work, they are clever and persistent in their desire to secure food and housing for themselves. As you can probable see by the photo this bird feeder has a long clear plastic seed tube that makes up the body of the feeder and providing a visible place to store the bird seed. The bird feeder dimensions are 25 in. H x 11.7 in. W x 11.7 in. D; the seed tube is about 4 inches in diameter and will hold a substantial amount of seed, up to 3 pounds! Here is a promotional blurb I found on this product from Perky-Pet:\"Best Used For: Attracting and feeding birds without allowing squirrels to get the seed. This unique squirrel-proof feeder will increase your bird traffic while minimizing seed lost to squirrels.\"This feeder has an attractive shiny metal saucer-shaped lid (or as Perky-Pet calls it \"a dome\") that connects to the top of the plastic seed tube. There is a hole at the center of the saucer to connect the two parts and at the same time provides a place for a ring to be fastened on the top of the dome for hanging. The dome is part of this new squirrel-baffling bird feeder, along with a very cleverly designed metal base that comes already attached to the bottom of the seed tube. There are four holes (or ports) about the size of dime around the metal base right through the seed tube. These holes are the feeding ports. Small perches are also attached to the base in front of each feeding port and are made out of metal just like the base for durability. Considering the dimensions of the perches and the feeding ports this bird feeder is obviously made for small lightweight birds; No crows or pigeons allowed!Now let's get to the patented weight-activated base and other features of this squirrel-baffling bird feeder. The smooth metal dome is not secured tightly to the top of the seed tube which allows it to wobble around when any weight is applied from above or below; like from a squirrel or large bird. According to Perky-Pet: \"The dome tilts and wobbles as well to throw squirrels off balance who try and land on the feeder.\" This also applies to those pesky crows that dominate our backyard in the mornings, scaring away the smaller birds we are trying to feed. Likewise, if weight is applied to the base, such as by a leaping squirrel, chipmunk or a large bird, the base swivels like a bucket under their weight, automatically closing off access to the feeder ports and preventing the loss of seed.There is very little assembly required. Perky-Pet has included an excellent sheet of instructions that are easy to follow and is written in English only. In fact, there are only two steps to complete assembly. All assembly applies to attaching the dome to the seed tube; everything else comes already assembled. During assembly one thing concerned me. The seed tube is plastic and there are two small holes on opposite sides to attach the dome to the seed tube by poking the ends of a metal bracket through the holes. This feeder is not light and once 3 pounds of birdseed is added it is quite heavy. In my opinion, this is the weakest link of the Perky-Pet bird feeder. In order to prevent a future disaster I decided to drill-out the small holes so I could insert a 2-piece hard rubber grommet into each new hole. This allowed me to still insert the metal bracket as designed while also providing reinforcement for the plastic seed tube. Only time will tell whether my modification will prolong the life of the feeder, or not.Perky-Pet has three short and informative videos on their website explaining (1) How the Squirrel-Be-Gone Baffler works, (2) Where to place your bird feeder and (3) Instructions for cleaning the feeder. You can Google the website by typing the following in your browser window: perky-pet squirrel-be-gone baffler model 397.I had originally intended to hang the bird feeder on one of my wrought iron shepherd staff hanging poles but decided not to when I realized the bottom of this 25-inch bird feeder would only be hanging about 3 feet off the ground; much too low and inviting for the numerous non-flying animals that roam around my backyard. After I watched the videos mentioned above I decided to relocate my bird feeder to a higher point and nearer to our birdbath; I also added a hook to the end of the metal strap I am now using to hang the feeder from a protruding galvanized metal pole mounted horizontally on the bottom roof line of a large shed in the backyard. I have to use a stepladder to hang and remove the bird feeder, but that is no problem. This product was built in the USA with both U.S. and Chinese parts. The label information on the front of the box is written in English, French and Spanish.Overall I am pleased with this new bird feeder. The squirrels and crows have tried to access the feeder without success so far; the wobble and tilt action has definitely kept them off guard. However, they are crafty and persistent animals and since there has been a minor amount of seed loss, mostly during the recent wind storm, the seed that did fall to the ground has kept them motivated to devise new ways to thwart the security measures built into this new Perky-Pet bird feeder.On the front of the box Perky-Pet added the following statement:\"Feeder base and dome tilt to baffle the squirrels and protect your bird seed! Birds feed undisturbed from 4 feeding ports.\"I think Perky-Pet is overreaching reasonable expectations for this product by expecting small birds to feed undisturbed. There is always some animal around my neighborhood looking for a free meal; either in the form of birdseed or in the shape of a bird. Though it would be nice, so far undisturbed feeding is not the norm around here.Otherwise, The Baffler has worked as promised. Since there are moving parts it stands to reason that some attention will be necessary in the future to ensure the mechanisms continue to wiggle, tilt and wobble. There is no mention about maintenance on the Perky-Pet website that I could find. Only time will tell how well this new feeder will work over the long haul. Since much of the Perky-Pet Squirrel-Be-Gone: The Baffler is manufactured with metal parts I expect my Perky-Pet bird feeder will outlast most if not all of the plastic and wooden bird feeders on the market. This bird feeder retails new for $73.99, which is a hefty price for what you are purchasing. I know you can shop around and buy this bird feeder for much less than that."

It's expensive, it's difficult to clean because of the way the lid attaches to the base. The feed holes are too small as well. I would pass on this; just too many negatives."

        "text": "I have this hanging outside for a month now, and I'm still waiting to see a squirrel fall off it. They don't seem interested in investigating it yet - perhaps the dome is doing its job of keeping the squirrel away from the perch. The perch is supposed to tilt when a squirrel clings on to it, both denying the squirrel access to the birdseed, as well as throwing it off balance and possibly off the feeder.The feeder comes with the top unassembled. My first problem with it came when I tried to assemble it. The nut provided did not hold the dome securely - when I put a light pressure (say, 2 pounds) on the dome, it will push the nut off the hook. I called customer support, who offered to replace the entire feeder. I decided to get a replacement nut from the hardware store instead. Strangely, I could not find a nut that fit exactly, with either metric or Imperial threading - so the problem might be with the threaded hook. However, two metric threaded nuts worked where 1 didn't.The reason why I'm worried about how long this will last is that the seed tube is made of plastic. Near the top, a metal rod goes through holes on either side of the tube. There's no reinforcement, and this being a rather large feeder, a lot of weight is being supported by a bit of plastic.There also doesn't look like a good way of disassembling the bottom of the feeder in order to wash it properly.I haven't yet seen a squirrel being thwarted by this yet, so I'll rate it based on my observation of it so far. I'll update the review when I have more information."

        "text": "This is an attractive looking, functional feeder and was easy to assemble. The only problem I had was that the unit shipped with the wrong size nut needed to secure the baffle to the hook. Nothing I had at home would fit properly either. I took the hook to my local hardware store and the correct nut is a metric size. Twenty cents later I had the correct part and was able to complete the assembly.I have had the feeder hanging in a tree for a few weeks now and the little birds love it. They took to it within a day or two. [It sometimes takes a week or so for the birds to find a new feeder. I have four other feeders in my yard so the regulars are used to finding food here.] The larger birds have trouble with the little perches. This keeps the Grackles and Starlings from emptying the feeder but it also discourages the Cardinals.The squirrels and chipmunks have not been able to get to the seed by climbing the feeder - however - there is a fair amount of spillage from the tray which ends up on the ground. The chipmunks are having a feast sitting underneath it. The additional of a seed catcher would be nice.The true test of a feeder is whether it will withstand a Midwest winter and ever hungrier squirrels as natural food supplies dwindle. Right now the squirrels aren't that interested. They are curious and jump on it, but don't try too hard. I'm also concerned about the sturdiness of the plastic and how well it will hold up when temperatures go below freezing. I will update as the seasons progress."

        "text": "My back yard is a haven for all sorts of wildlife- not just birds, but rabbits, squirrels, chipmunks and the occasional skunk. I choose plants that encourage wildlife, and I never use pesticides or herbicides. I've never had a bird feeder, though. I was always worried about the effects of artificially feeding birds, but I was recently reassured by a naturalist that birds get their food from a great many sources, and one more source really won't make a difference. And so I ordered this feeder.Looking at the list price, you'd expect it to be a pretty hefty, solidly-built device. If you did, though, you'd be wrong. There are a couple of stampings, a molded base, a thin plastic tube, a couple of springs, some pieces of steel rod for perches... and that's it. It comes mostly preassembled, requiring only that you attach the mounting ring at the top of the feeder. That piece did give me some concern, as the main thing supporting several pounds of seed and feeder is a skinny #6 screw. New, it has more than enough strength, but a few years outdoors might weaken it through corrosion.Filling the feeder is easy, although my first attempt resulted in a pound of birdseed scattered on my back porch. It was running out through the bottom of the feeder, and I couldn't figure out why until I discovered a black plastic cap about an inch in diameter lying in the bottom of the box. It's not shown in the wordless assembly instructions, but I managed to figure out that kit is supposed to close off the bottom of the seed chamber. It slips on to part of the molding that composes the inside of the base, with less than 1/2\" of overlap. The only thing really holding it in place is the weight of the birdseed in the tube. Once the level of the seed falls below this cap, it could easily become dislodged, and the seed inside could run out. I considered gluing it on but that would make it impossible to access the springs inside if they became unhooked or broke. Once I had this figured out, filling the feeder was easy enough, although I was also concerned that the tube is suspended by two very thin steel wires that are inserted in two small holes in the plastic tube. This also seems like a potential point of failure.  I hung the feeder under my maple tree, using a lightweight steel chain- something squirrels were unlikely to be able to chew though.That was several days ago, and since then we've had two heavy rainstorms, neither of which managed to get any water into the feeder. That's good. I haven't seen any squirrels try to get in, and I don't see any seed spilled below the feeder- which suggests that perhaps the birds have yet to discover the feeder. It may well be that food is plentiful enough this time of year that the birds really are stressed enough to look for new food sources. I suspect that when cold weather comes, they might be a bit more motivated. I'll be watching the feeder regularly between now and then (my home office has a clear view of the feeder) and I'll update as the birds and squirrels discover the feeder. I'll also update if any parts fail along the way.Update: A close inspection of the ground below shows evidence that the birds have indeed discovered the feeder, and it looks like the level of seed may have dropped a bit- I'm going to put a mark on the tube to monitor the level. No signs of squirrel activity.Update II: The birds have definitely discovered it. There isn't too much wasted seed on he ground, but the level of seed has fallen least rabble, and I've observed several birds feeding on- and right now it looks like two robins are having a bit of a fight over who has priority on it. Still can't give it any more than three stars, given the cost and construction, but it's good to see that the birds are making use of it.Update III: The birds- or a combination of birds and other scavengers- are now consuming seed at a rate of two or three pounds a day from the feeder. I just refilled it, and  I noticed a good deal of seed on the ground as well. As I type this on my back porch, there are four small birds on the feeder, and about eight or nine scavenging seed on  the ground below.A this point I'm undecided as to whether I'll keep filling the feeder, get another, smaller, feeder, or just discontinue feeding until winter. I'll probably buy another 20 lb bag before I make up my mind.Followup: It's now June, and the feeder has been hanging in my yard since last August. It doesn't look any worse for the wear. There are no paint chips, no rust, no cracks in the plastic reservoir. In short, it looks pretty much the way it did when I hung it 10 months ago.  I've discovered a number of things since first hanging it, too. Most commercial seed mixes at the big box stores are full of milo, a seed that no bird appears to care for, although they'll eat it in an emergency. The best deals are to be found at country feed stores, buying mixes or making your own. I use a mixture that's mainly of black sunflower seed, some cracked corn, safflower seed, and occasionally some cracked peanuts. This has something for just about every bird found around here, and has drawn a much wider range of birds to my yard than I've seen in the past 27 years. I plan on adding a noter feeder or two, using different mixes in them feeders to get different birds, and maybe add a few birdhouses as well.July Update: I was working at one end of the yard when I heard a crash and turned just in time to see a squirrel sailing through the air after bouncing off the roof of the feeder. They still haven't figured out a way in, but one or two of the smarter ones may have realized than sitting on the feeder and shaking it can dislodge seed do they can eat what falls to the ground below- see the photo."

        "text": "There really is a lot to like about this bird feeder. I live in the Pacific Northwest in extreme Western Washington, and this is now one of 6 feeders that I have so YMMV (your mileage may vary).I have waited some time before adding this review to observe how my birds have adjusted to the feeder. It has taken some time, but they are, very slowly ,and very gradually, becoming more used to it and using it a bit more. The chickadees and the nut-hatches are finally responding and are feeding from the feeder with greater frequency. The slow start to use this feeder seems to be that in order to get to the seed the birds have to stick their heads into the openings, something many birds seem to be hesitant to do it seems.The Good:1.  Very well constructed with quality materials. This feeder will last a long time and, I think, will hold up to weather and use.2.  It performs as advertised, and it really does thwart squirrels, and for my location, raccoons as well.3.  The top also also has the added advantage of keeping the food more dry in wet conditions thanks to the overhang from the anti-squirrel proof curved top.The Not So Good:1.  Many of the birds seem very hesitant to use this feeder, as mentioned above it may be because they really hae to stick their head into the opening to get to the seed. I use a \"premium\" blend. Perhaps another sort of feed mix would be more attractive to them> I'm not sure since this blend has had them doing through 20#of seed in a week generally.2.  The level of seed has not gone down much in this feeder after nearly three weeks of use. The birds have been coming to the feeder a little more each day though, so I am cautiously hopeful. I hope that they will gradually become more accustomed to the feeder, but it is a slow process for them it seems.3.  I have not had such a slow response to any other feeder, and Perky Pets feeders have always been a favorite choice for me.So - you see that I don't have a very solid positive answer for this feeder, nor can I say definitively that it does not work. Perhaps the species that you generally attract may make a difference?We attract chickadees, nuthatches, flickers, woodpeckers, various finches, cedar wax wings, juncos, doves, and a host of smaller birds. I have a year round population.I want to love this feeder because it really is made well, but at this point, about 3 weeks after purchase I have some reservations. I have seen an increase in use since I first put it up."

They've managed to get into every bird feeder I've used and ruined most of them. This feeder is sturdy. It also works to keep the squirrels off, at least so far. I hung it on a moderately high branch where it's easy for me to fill and so far the birds have figured it out, but the squirrels are kept at bay. I hope this continues.The feeder can hold three pounds of seed. That, of course, depends on the type of see you use. This is another plus for me. We have a lot of birds here and the other feeders would run out after one or two days. So far this one has lasted a week.The price is rather high, although not all that much worse than the feeders in the stores in town, but if it keeps the squirrels away and lasts several seasons, it's worth it. It's certainly better than investing in a new bird feeder every year and having it ruined."

        "text": "Our last two birdfeeders have been smaller Perky-Pet models and they've been fine. Priced at about $20, and perfectly serviceable and bird-popular even if squirrels have easily solved them.So I wanted to see how Perky-Pet's high-end \"squirrel-be-gone\" model would work. I did not pay for it, but got it free through the Amazon Vine review program.As a product it's well-made and while I think a smart squirrel will still get some food out of it, I do think this will make it difficult for them. The way the food dispenser tilts and wobbles will make it very difficult for an animal to maintain a long grip. They'll fall, and while they'll come back, they'll fall again.My other feeder, the squirrel could just hang out until I squirted him with water. This one will make them work much harder, and hopefully he gets tired of it and moves on.But is that worth $75? I just don't see how. Bird seed's not that expensive, so even if a squirrel does eat a bunch of seed, how long would it take for him to eat $50 worth of seed? However, I only deal with one smart squirrel - so if you've got several, then it's a different issue. Still, the price seems high for what is basically a fun luxury item.This is a big feeder. I have the tallest shepherd's crook, and this hangs down far enough to be difficult to see under the railings of my porch. Luckily, we can see two of the four portals even if it's a little obstructed. The point is that this is a large 3-pound feeder, and will be a big change if you're used to those smaller, cheaper versions.The size is matched with quality. This has some weight to it, and is not one of those cheap plastic models that seems to age very quickly. I think this model will have a longer useful life. I usually get rid of a feeder once a year, usually after winter, but I bet this one would last.Ultimately, while I like the product and I think it's well-made and should live up to most of its claims, the price makes it so I can't go above three stars. But - a $75 feeder that last 4-5 years is better than paying $20 for a new feeder after every winter. So IF this lasts 3-4 years I would have a different opinion.The birds use this fine - like any new feeder, took a few days, but once they got used to it they all sit there and eat all day."

        "text": "A rather large, mostly plastic feeder intended to deter squirrels.It's larger than I expected, and flimsier.  The tube isn't quite as rigid as I'd like, the top is attached by a single small bolt/nut, and the bottom is attached via a single spring.  I'm not sure how many seasons this construction will hold up through the variable, wet winters we have here in Maryland (frequent changes from cold to warmer).The unit arrives mostly assembled.  For storage, the top has to come off (since the top is a \"baffle\", it flops over in storage).  Since the feeding ports are only at the bottom of the feeder, I had to hang it a little higher than I had planned (so it was still visible from my ground floor windows).  Even so, I have to stand near the window to see the feeding ports.The large capacity means less refills are needed, but between lots of seed sitting out, and the design that seems will encourage seed to stick to the bottom of the feeder, I'm concerned I'll get moldy seed and have to scrub this thing out more often than I like-- I prefer the kind where I can easily dump out the dregs without scrubbing or washing.The baffle is pretty garden-variety, and I've seen my squirrels handily climb over baffles like this one (it's not particularly wide nor does it swing/swivel vary hard). The bottom design is innovative and seems like a squirrel clinging would cause the port nearest the squirrel to close, but the crafty little rodents may be able to twist their bodies to still get to the port on the other side.So far, the only birds who've discovered the feeder are chickadees who are trying to get seed from the ports but seem off-put by how far in they have to reach to do so.  That means at this point, I'm not sure how well the feeder works, since neither most of the birds nor my squirrels have discovered the new source of food.  I'm not sure if it's the unusual feeder configuration (my usual feeder is a hanging platform with an anti-squirrel grid), or that the temperature fall has meant lots of other food options for the local fauna.  I'll update once I get more activity, particularly of the furry kind.UPDATE: The chickadees figured it out first, and still are the ones who most like this feeder.  The tufted titmouses use it some also, but I haven't seen any larger birds on this feeder.  The only squirrel observed was eating spilled seed under the feeder, rather than trying to get into the feeder.  One morning I found the feeder in pieces on the ground (nothing broken, the nut/bolt apparently came out of the hook), which might have been the result of a curious raccoon-- but reinforces my concerns about the feeder's construction, so I'm maintaining the 3-star rating.For the time being, I like the idea of this feeder but am ambivalent about the design and durability, especially at this high price point."

        "text": "I have tried numerous supposedly squirrel-proof feeders over the years.  This is a pretty basic design.  The top keeps squirrels from crawling down fro the top (but they can still jump from nearby branches if not carefully placed).  The bottom is on a spring that closes when the weight of a bigger squirrel (grey) lands.  However, some smaller squirrels, like red, or chipmunks are too light to lower the bottom and can access the seed.These kind of feeders usually work well for a year or two, then get knocked down by deer or bear and the top gets chewed by something (probably the grey squirrels).  They do work pretty well until that time.I have had it hanging for nearly 6 months and have had very little bird interest.  I think it is because I primarily use black oil sunflower seed and they just don't come out well from this feeder.  The benefit of this is that squirrels and deer are not able to tip the seed out. The downside is that the birds also have trouble.  My other feeders are filled with birds and empty quickly.  This pretty much just sits there unless the other feeders are emptied.  I could switch to a seed mix, but the majority of that goes uneaten.  Safflower would probably work, but that isn't very popular in my area.I do think it is very hard to fill.  I had to add an s-hook between the feeder and top baffle to be able to hang it easily.  I won't buy another if a bear steals this."

I jumped at the chance to review this Perky-Pet Squirrel proof feeder. I have used Perky Pet products in the past (their hummingbird feeders are the best) and always been pleased with them. This bird feeder, however, has been a disappointment.First, the good news: It appears well constructed and it holds a lot of birdseed. It is fairly simple to put together and hang. I've had the feeder up almost one month now and I can report that yes, it is squirrel-proof. They have not been able to get to it.But now, for the bad news: the birds don't seem to like it either. I filled all 3 of our feeders, this one included, and while the other 2 older feeders were empty within days, this feeder still remains almost full of seeds after almost 4 weeks. I have seen birds perched at it but the feeder just isn't popular with them. I suspect that the openings near the base (where the birds have access to the food) isn't obvious to them and they have to stick their heads inside to actually get to the seed. Perhaps it is just sunflower seeds that don't do well in the feeder. I will plan to try another type of seed and ammend this review if there is a difference."

When a squirrel jumps at the feeder, the metal dome tilts and wobbles to throw the critter off balance. The weight-activated base also tilts to close off the four feeding ports.

It comes almost fully assembled as all you need to do is put the top dome and the inner top cap on. So now for why I feel it needs a 2.0 version. First the clear plastic cylinder that holds the feed has two small drilled holes at the top that the inner cap clicks into with pins. I know that its just a matter of time before the holes start to crack and then split and no longer hold the pins. I think they need to reinforce those hole areas with something (i'll use some duct tape of something myself). The other problem and this may just be an oversight is that there is a nut that you use on the inside to fasten the dome/hook hanging knob. Well, that nut is bigger than the hook/screw and just falls off and doesn't secure the dome at all. I called the company and the telephone number on the instructions insert are wrong so I went to the website to verify. Once I got a person on the phone they were very polite, apologized for the bad part. They had initially told me to return the feeder to Amazon and get a new one since it was brand new. I had to mention that I was doing a review thru the Vine program and she immediately said it would be no problem to send out the one part to fix the issue. I also asked if anyone else had called about this issue and she said she hadn't heard anything but would mention it to the appropriate department.Squirrels are clever critters so i'm constantly changing/rotating out my feeders to try and keep them guessing. Some will still figure out a way, as most jump on it and hit it hard enough to make the seed fall out. Which is what I think will happen on this one but I don't think they can hang from it like a bat and eat from it. It is heavier than most feeders so be aware that it really needs a strong line or what ever you are hooking it on to. I did notice (and this may change in the future) The price is $72.00 on Amazon but on the Perky-Pet website its only $59.00 Its way too expensive for a bird feeder but it is made of good materials and sturdy. For me if it wasn't for the Amazon Vine program to get this, i'd pass on it because of the high price."

        "text": "I hung this feeder in the same spot as another squirrel proof feeder that the squirrels never defeated but never stopped trying to vanquish it either.The squirrel-be-gone feeder is large with it's eventual weight determined by the type and amount of seed used to fill it. Listed capacity is three pounds, but we keep it half full to keep the weight down. Filled to capacity this feeder requires sturdy support.It is easy to assemble the feeder with the only challenging part the piece that hooks into the plastic tube. Filling the tube is no harder than filling any other feeder of this type though I found that using a funnel makes filling much easier and neater. The base and baffle are made of powder coated metal - I'm guessing aluminum because a magnet doesn't stick to it.Most importantly, does it keep the squirrels at bay? So far I'd have to say yes because mostly they don't even try to get into this feeder. Even if they could get past the baffle, the perches are too small for a squirrel to grasp securely. Even the Rodan-sized blackbirds in our yard have a difficult time getting food out of this feeder because the perches are too tiny for them also.A deer had mastered the other squirrel proof feeder and regularly emptied it. I don't think Bambi will be ever to get seed out of this feeder.Yes, I was also taken aback by the listed price for this feeder. Yet, the price has gone down at least five dollars since I first saw it posted, and on the day I'm writing this review it's on sale at the Perky-Pet site for 59 dollars. Those who have spent years battling the squirrels might not mind paying this much for a squirrel-proof feeder that actually works.UPDATE -  I filled the feeder to the top; it holds lots of seed. The next morning the feeder was completely empty. We suspect deer who have previously emptied our other feeders. Will have to monitor the situation."

        "text": "The Perk Pet 397 is almost like the Cadillac of anti Squirrel Technology. The top baffle helps serve to \"baffle\" the enemy, while allowing some birds to maybe stop and perch on the edges... but, if they are too weighty, the baffle will tilt, kicking them off the top. Very few birds I've seen on the feeder have tried landing on the baffle, so it may not work as a perch anyway.Baffles are old hat in the battle against the Squirrel Invading Army, however, so Perky Pet has enlisted even further help. The perch section on the lower portion of the feeder is spring loaded, so that when something too heavy for the feeder touches down, the battle line is closed and the invasion repelled.Unlike the Droll Yankee, THE M1 Abrams in the Squirrel Invasion Prevention Army, is much more expensive than this model. I do not own one, but I can see how someone would want one if they have a bigger squirrel problem than just 2-3 of the little pains. This, of course, in no way justifies the cost of the Perky Pet 397, as $75 is a really expensive feeder. Sure, it works, but you better have a really bad squirrel issue to buy into this one in my opinion.Missing is the ability to adjust the sensitivity of the perch latch, though I've seen a few cardinals on ours, so I assume such birds wont be an issue and will still be able to feed.The feeder is easy to assemble and easy to fill. One thing to note, if you plan to fill this to capacity, ensure wherever you are hanging it has the ability to withstand the heavy load. This thing holds a lot of seed.Overall, I'm happy with the feeder and its squirrel thwarting capabilities. Where I struggle is the price. For $50 you can buy 2 baffles, one for above and one for below a regular feeder. Unless you give the little suckers a place to hang out between the 2 baffles, you pretty much succeed with squirrel immunity. If you want an all in one solution, have the ability to hang this with a full load of seed and just want to hang it and forget it, this is definitely not a bad solution to the Squirrel Invasion."

At first I tried regular birdseed, but the birds didn't seem to care for it. They couldn't (or maybe just wouldn't) dig through the mix of seeds to find their favorites. After seeing the seed level not going down, I decided to swap out the seed for black oil sunflower seeds. The only birds to use it (and still very sparingly) are the goldfinches. Everything here still prefers the other feeders and will pretty much ignore this even when the other feeders stood empty for a few days.The feeder design itself is really interesting. It is large and holds a nice amount of seed (up to 3 pounds!), so you are not filling all the time. The cover is not attached to the feeder, but instead the feeder hooks to it, allowing the cover to wiggle and not let any creatures to sit comfortably on the top. The perches are attached to a free moving base that will tip and close off the food so any unwanted visitors cannot get to the food.This feeder really seems to work well, but my birds don't seem to like it. Maybe this winter will be different as food becomes more scarce."

It was impossible to secure it, and thus the top wobbles a bit.-tube plastic, part holding the seeds, is a bit thin.  It has to be squeezed slightly in order for the 2 prongs that hold the top on to be inserted, which gives me concern it will not hold up well in windy conditions.-seeds (1/4 to 1/2 cup) fall out of the bottom when filling the container and/or anytime the feeder is set on a solid surface.-bottom portion wiggles around the tube, seems way to loose, maybe that is why so many seeds fall out.-It does hold a lot of seeds, but the rather flimsy construction and materials gives me pause for concern. Especially considering the entire thing is held together by 2 tiny prongs, one in each side of the tube top.observation:-only very small birds have room to land on the tiny perches-the holes to feed from are very small, and there is a gap between the opening and where the seeds actually are, so again, only a small bird head will fit inside the hole to reach the seeds.Opinion:For the price, currently $73 on Amazon, there are better, more sturdy options. I have and currently use several cheaper and better feeders than this one.**Edit Oct 3, 2013 -- So after only a few weeks, I had to take down the feeder as the bottom was falling out.

        "text": "Simple assembly (two minutes worth) is required for this feeder.  The tube has two holes in the top into which you insert the  metal prongs on the roof (you cannot see this in the stock photos, as it is covered by the squirrel dome).  I have uploaded a photo of the top. The roof has a 2 inch  opening for seed and a bar across it, so that the baffle part can hook onto it.  To fill you have two choices, remove the top by slightly squeezing the plastic,  the plastic is flexible enough for this, but I am not sure if that is what it was designed for and am afraid that squeezing it may stress it.  Or you can try to pour the seed through the opening, which is not easy because the bar across the top tends to deflect the seed.  I really do not like this, especially because the tube itself tends to move around when you set it down due the spring loaded bottom designed to keep squirrels out.We have Abert squirrels (darling but clever things that look like koalas).  They are acrobatic and determined.  They do not seem to be able to access the feeder after a few days (and they usually do get into them quickly) but it remains to be seen if they will learn.  Birds do not seem to have a problem.This feeder is not worth the current price over seventy dollars.  The metal parts are a lot nicer than most birdfeeders, and the bottom works well but I feel that the design of the top is really lacking.  I am concerned about all the weight on the small prongs that stick out and filling it is a pain. The plastic part is also not much better than my 20 dollar feeder.  Filling it so annoying, that I cannot recommend it at all.  I have a couple of the Perky Pet 102 Squirrel Resistant feeders, (you can get three of those, with some money left over for the price of this one) that have multiple ports (which birds like) and which are MUCH easier to fill.  Squirrels can get a bit of food from them, but they do have to work a bit for it.  Try one of those first if squirrels are a pest.  I am going to use the baffle (which is very nice powder coated metal) for my one of my other Perky Pet feeders.  If the baffle were sold separately, I would buy some more of those."

Once it's on the window you have to wrestle the entire assembly off to refill, and then go through the tortuous process of remounting the suction cups.

It's stayed up for years without any problem.I also read some reviews where people said they had trouble filling it.

If you want to get down to the bottom of a tube feeder where it really gets nasty over time, you will need to pick up a long bottle brush.  Also, if you do buy this brush for use on feeder ports, I would toss the suggestion of keeping it around your sink for other uses that's mentioned in the description.  You will be bringing in all kinds of bacteria from dirty feeders into your kitchen.  You can wash it well of course, but it's still a better idea to either keep one of these strictly for other uses than feeders, or buy some other brush for your kitchen sink.

My first outing with it last summer was a total bust.  I mean I mixed the stuff, put it out in two nice clean feeders and saw nothing get attracted to it but ants and bees.  If any hummingbirds did bother to stop by and sample it, they were obviously disappointed for they never came back.  Personally I never eyed a single one hovering over it.  At first I thought that I may have gotten started with feeding them too late. I live in New England where we only get one species of hummer that comes this far north, (the ruby throated).  It's important to get your feeders up in early spring and then they will find it and remain loyal to you.  But this spring I was johnny on the spot with the feeders and the same no show was going on.  I decided to try another brand of mix after this last outing.  (I know you can make it at home easier and cheaper, but just not worth the mess and trouble to me. Just my opinion, but its stands).  I decided to try the Mills Brothers nectar after reading the positive reviews for it here on Amazon.  Within just a week of flushing the old feeders and putting in the Mills brand, I had two dedicated hummers dining regularly at my troth.  I love it. It's definitely a little pricier than this mix, but well worth it, trust me.  I don't really know if any other brand or home made mix would do the same trick as the Mills, but I don't really care.  I found something that's reasonably priced, easy to use, and the hummers love it so I am sticking with it.  In conclusion, I don't bother to get involved in the debate about this Perky Pet stuff being junk food or bad for the hummers.  Personally I think that a lot of folks get a little too excited and go overboard with the panic over additives and colorings etc.  My main disappointment and concern with this stuff is strictly limited to the hummers not liking it.  It may have something to do with my dismal results being that I am forced to only deal with one species of hummer here, but the end result is that this Perky Pet mix has been a complete failure for me, and the Mills Brothers a hit even this early on in the season. I have left a link to the Mills brand, and my recommendation is that you skip this stuff and go for what seems to really work...Mills Brothers Hummingbird Food 3-Ounce Packet, 3-Pack"

Just as we began to feel a bit of disappointment, we were encouraged when we noticed that the fluid level dropped a bit.Following directions, we emptied and cleaned the feeder at week's end and then refilled it -- and that is when the nectar carnage really started! As week #2 of our feeder experience really got underway, the feeders emptied in about four days and we began to see hummingbirds coming and going at all times of the day. Guess the word got out!By the middle of the fourth week, the 16 ounce feeder was emptying every 2.5 days or so and the 8 ounce feeder in a day or two. We had wonderfully colored green, yellow, blue and kinda magenta hummingbirds flying around in singles and in pairs, and they are awesome to watch. They love this nectar, flying in to land on the feeder's perch and sipping until content, then buzzing right off. There were even times when hummers seemed to do a little battle for prime sitting position, with the 'winner' forcing the other one(s) to hover just a few inches away (im)patiently waiting for their tuns. Very interesting and beautiful to watch.It's November and night-time temperatures are dipping below freezing, and our hummingbirds seem to have migrated away now. Can't wait to get the feeders and nectar back out in the Spring and watch them frolic again.Highly recommended! Totally fascinating."

All you need to do is bring 4 parts water to a boil, and 1 part white sugar, let boil a couple of minutes and let it cool. If you are too lazy to do this, you shouldn't be feeding hummers. It only takes a few minutes, and you can make more and store it in the fridge for up to 2 weeks. Hummingbirds also get their nutrition from real flower nectar, and small insects."

What else would you want? OK...so some people will be put off by the fact that it's electric. Big deal. Get yourself an extension cord. I have a lot that's 150 feet deep and it's no problem maneuvering this thing with a cord attached to it. As far as noise goes, this this is a bit noisy...but it's a leaf blower!!! What are you expecting? Silence? The nice thing about the noise is that it's more of a low roar instead of a high-pitched whining sound like my neighbor's blower (which drives my wife and me crazy). Now...about the vac feature. If you're looking for a heavy duty leaf vac/shredder, this ain't it. It does have a plastic impeller and you have to be careful not to suck up any rocks or thick sticks. In fact, this is my second one of these blowers. I had the first one for three years and had no problems with either the blower or vac part. Then my 10-year-old decided to see if it was powerful enough to suck up a small rock from the garden. Indeed, it was. But the rock broke the plastic impeller, and that was the end of it (man...what a horrible sound THAT made!). But is should show you something that I went right to Amazon and ordered the exact same blower to replace it. I may use this one mostly as a blower. I'll use the vac, but only to suck up stray leaves on the driveway and in hard to reach places. I honestly believe if you're looking to vac up big piles of leaves, a much more heavy duty piece of equipment is in order. But if you're looking for an excellent blower at an excellent price, which will do minor vacuuming of leaves, this unit is perfect. You really can't beat the price. At under $60.00, I don't think you'll find a better made, more powerful, well-built unit. This thing really blows!!!!"

I was going to mount it right away, but now have decided to run the plastic one until it breaks or wears, then switch to the magnesium one. It makes sense to do this, as the magnesium impeller is very light, yet this Super unit is 4 lbs less than the Ultra, which helps at the end of the day."

        "text": "I have had this mower for five seasons so far, during which I typically have to mow twice per week from March through October or even November.  In other words, this mower has seen lots of use, and it hasn't failed me.There are several reasons I love this mower:1)  I am allergic to gasoline, so I avoid using it as much as possible.  Therefore, it is extraordinarily helpful to have an electric mower that allows me to avoid yard-based gasoline-guzzling &#34;appliances&#34; completely.2) It is light-weight, so I can handle it on my own.3) The handle easily folds down so it takes up less room in storage during the winter,4) Because it is electric, I can flip it upside down to clean it out without worrying about spilling any toxic chemicals.5) It does a very good job cutting grass!  This is important in a mower!  It also does a good job mulching grass clippings.6) It can handle hills without any issue.7) It is easy to adjust the cutting height.  In fact, the cutting height can be adjusted with one hand, by moving the handl on the left side of the mower.8) It is QUIET!  This mower emits less than half the noise polution that a typical mower emits.  I could probably mow very early in the morning and not annoy my neighbors too much. :)9) It doesn't pollute the air the way gas-powered mowers do.10) It is easy to start, with no pulling, keys, or other obstacles.  Just plug this baby in, pull up on the little orange handle (on the main handle), and mow.  That's it!Using a cord can be annoying at times, but it is something to which I QUICKLY became accustomed, and I quickly set up my &#34;ballet routine&#34; of mowing while avoiding the cord.  It isn't that bad. :)"

        "text": "This is my first electric lawnmower, and so far, I absolutely love it.  It is smaller, quieter, lighter, cleaner, and more efficient than your typical gas mower, and there is no risk of throwing out your back trying to start it.  It is one of my best buys at Amazon.The mower was shipped in the original box, with the housing nicely supported by cardboard inserts to protect, and minimize vibration.  Remarkably, a single strip of clear tape held the cover down.  The mower is relatively easy to assemble, and does not require any hand tools.  The instruction manual is pretty thorough, except for a couple of parts related to assembly, where a little better description, and larger diagrams would help.  Although it is stated in the manual that `no lubrication is necessary', lubricating the bolts on the handle before assembly, and even finished metal parts like the handle, will help deter corrosion.  The springs in the power handle and grass guard, would also benefit from spray lubricant.Once assembled, the mower is ready for immediate use.  Favoring the right-handed majority, the power switch is on the right side.  The motor starts up smoothly, and is relatively quiet, even when running at full power.  The whooshing sound generated, probably isn't much louder than a large electric weedwacker.  Since the motor is near the ground, and enclosed by a green plastic cover, the sound doesn't carry too much.  Motor speed can be controlled using the throttle lever, though the mower is designed to be run at full throttle most of the time.The blade height is set using a lever located at the left rear wheel, and is adjustable in approximately half inch increments, from about one inch, to three and a half inches.  The motor on this mower is probably not strong enough to cut a heavy lawn with grass higher than say three inches down to the one inch level, without stalling.  Running a motor with the rotor locked, is not a good thing, so avoid trying to force your way through tough spots.  Cutting narrower strips of lawn is one option.  Or you may need to start with the blade at a higher level, and then drop it down to one inch on the second pass.  If there are just a few high spots, the old technique of raising the front of the mower, and cutting them down, and then going over the area again, might do the trick.  It sounds like a lot of work, but consider that an electric mower is much lighter and easier to maneuver.Grass will collect at the discharge area.  The spring-loaded plastic deflector has some deep depressions that get clogged with grass.  If you don't clean the area out it could promote corrosion of the spring.  There is a gap between the green plastic outer cover and the metal framing that also gets filled with grass.  Perhaps a hard rubber seal in this gap, would be a good idea.  In general, the design of this area could be improved.There is a plastic strip at the back of the mower to help block debris that might blow backwards.  It is quite soft and flexible, and because it is quite close to the ground, it gets bent around and scraped up.  Possibly if it were made of harder plastic, and raised up a bit, it may last longer.  The wheels look quite sturdy and durable, and according to the manual, the wheels require no lubrication.Besides the normal safety concerns when using any lawn mower, users of a cord and plug electric mower, need to develop an awareness of, and a system for handling, the power cord.  Avoiding any possibility of overrunning the cord should be a primary concern.  What is recommended is if possible, mowing outwards from the source of power.  That way, you can try and minimize the chances of crossing over the cord while mowing.  Running the cord over my right shoulder, keeps it from trailing directly on the ground, and helps me keep track of where the cord is.  The mower has provisions for attaching the cord, and when connected properly, there is almost no chance that the cord will become detached.If you have a very large lawn, or one with heavy thick grass, this mower may not have enough power, and you may need to look at one of Black and Decker's other electrics with more powerful motors.  This machine has no problems handling my 2000 square feet of lawn, and I am very pleased with my purchase.  Easily five stars for this baby."

Used the electric mower until 2007, when I treated myself to a mow/blow/go gardner. I just stuck the machine out in the side yard and never touched it. In July 2008, I pulled it out to mow a newly planted lawn not covered by my mow/go guy. Plugged it in, and it started right away, try that with a gas mower. My new house has 2300 sf of front and back lawn, this mower just gobbles up that lawn. It does bog down in taller/thicker patches, hence only 4 stars. But it gives a nice clean cut. Changing the blade was easy. And it does a nice job of mulching, my lawns look great. I will never own a gas mower!"

        "text": "This is truly a good mower. I bought my first Black & Decker electric mower in 1972 and used it as my only mower until 1994. It received normal use on a normal sized subdivision lot. I absolutely loved it.Then, I moved to places that had much more land and the use of such was impossible. For the last few years, I've lived where there is a combination of riding mower and walk-behind needed. My gasoline walk-behind developed problems that were going to cost more to fix than it was worth. So, I bought this one.It took just a few minutes to get the mower assembled and the handle adjusted. I sprayed the underside with vegetable oil and started using it. It works great. It is heavy enough to not bounce around on uneven ground, but is light enough to let an old man with back and leg problems to push it around.This has the same problem as the Black & Decker corded tiller - the cheap plastic flip-our power switch and the worthless (and unusable) cord minder. Using a 12-3 cord is necessary for the distance I have to go with this and it just won't fit into the mower as designed. It also requires holding onto the mower with your right hand 100% of the time, regardless of the direction being mowed and where the cord is. I'm working on plans to modify the whole switch/cord thing. What a shame that this needs done.Yes, this is still a 5 star mower. The height adjustment is very easily used. There is ample power. The grass catcher works well, as does the mulching feature. It is a snap to keep clean. And, again, the weight is just right. I really, really like this. It seems that they assigned the mower development to people who knew what they were doing and the switch/cord development to someone who had never used an electric lawn tool."

        "text": "Moving to a smaller property back in 2003, I found myself no longer needing my riding mower. I looked at several options in the gas mower lineup. After talking to a couple of electric mower owners in my neighborhood, I went shopping at the local hardware store and brought home the earlier version of the Black & Decker MM875 Mower. Like other gas powered tool owners at that time, I seriously had my doubts. That changed after a few weeks use. I'm very surprised that after eight years, this mower is still up and running.Weighing in at 52 lbs, this 12 amp mower cuts a 19\" path in no time. With adjustable wheel heights ranging from 1.4\" to about 3.5\", it does a nice job. I like the one touch feature for wheel height adjustment. There's no fuss and tightness to contend with. I don't miss the noise of a gas powered motor. Unlike the newer version, my mower has a straight handle bar with a comfortable grip. The start handle is conveniently located on the right side and has a good feel to it. Other then that, there's really not that much of a change from the original.This mower is light and easy to maneuver around bushes and trees.  It does an average job of mulching. Mine came with the side discharge chute. The rear bag that now comes with the newer units was an optional purchase back in 2003. Even though I don't use it much, the folding handle is a nice add on for owners with tight spaces. As far as power cords go, I picked up a good 100 foot length 14/3 gauge outdoor extension cord. Its not that hard to manage the extension cord. When using any power tool, its all about staying alert.Like any piece of gear, proper maintenance is paramount. Prior to using this or any mower, its a good idea to coat the undercarriage with a non stick spray. I use the generic grilling spray on mine. I give the blades a good coating too. Since the body isn't metal, I use a rubber spatula to remove any buildup. Afterwards, a good wipe down. Its a good idea to inspect the bolts, nuts and screws for tightness after each use. Just like gas powered mowers, it does take a little bit of effort to remove and replace or sharpen the blade. I always sharpen my blade before the start of the mowing season and every other month. When sharpening the blade I use a fine tooth file. It can be sharpened with a good stone too. I got about 5 years out of one blade.Besides replacing the blade the back flap needed some help too. The original flap lasted me about 7 years and wasn't that difficult to remove and replace. Protection wise, Black & Decker offers a two year limited warranty on the mower and a lifetime package on the mower deck. I've not used their toll free customer support number for the mower, but I have for other Black & Decker products. The customer service that I did receive was outstanding.Overall, I am very satisfied with my Black & Decker mower. It has been a reliable lawn tool that quietly and efficiently gets the job done. With proper maintenance I expect to get another eight more years out of this one. In closing, I can honestly say that I don't miss my old gas mowers one bit."

        "text": "I've had this mower now for 3 seasons. And every time I fire it up, I recall the days of having to maintain an internal combustion engine. You don't have to change oil. You don't have to check spark plugs. You don't have to run the mower dry for over wintering. The only real maintenance we've had done is to sharpen the blades, and we did that last year with no fuss. That's it. Maintenance is blade sharpening. This saves me time and effort.Then there is the quality of life change as well. No more stinky clothes or hair from spent gasoline. No more deafening roar when I run the engine. Yes, the engine makes noise, but this electric mower must be an order of magnitude quieter. My fiance doesn't have to yell at me while mowing if she needs my attention, just speak in a louder voice.The mower is LIGHT. Sure, 50 lbs is unwieldy if you are carrying a package or something, but pushing 50 lbs around your yard? LIGHT.And then there is the one touch, single point height adjustment. Holy COW, this is just fantastic! Gone are the days where you have to adjust horrible levers, one per wheel, to get the proper height. Sure, newer mowers offer this capability and aren't corded, but coming from one that had 4 wheel painful adjustment, this is a dream come true.There are downsides to this mower. One is power. 12 amps has been enough, for the most part, to mow our lawn. In deep (5\") and wet grass, it starts strong but if you don't slow down, the engine will work itself to a stall of sorts. This is NO different than what we had with the electric mower though. I can't believe just how much power this thing really does have.Another problem is the power cord. First, make sure your house has an external power plug, otherwise you'll have to fish the extension cords out the window. And that's where the real annoyance to this mower lies, the power cord. Whereas with a regular mower you can just mow, mow, mow, with this one, you have to mow... be careful... mow. The cord will get in your way. The trick is to plan out the mowing in a way that will always keep the cord in the MOWED section of your lawn (not so easy with the first push, obviously). If you do this, cord maintenance is a non-issue mostly. If you have trees in your yard to mow around, this WILL be annoying, no doubt. If that is the case, you may want to invest instead in one with a battery (this mower does NOT have a battery, it MUST be plugged in). Or, if those aren't rated 12 amps or higher for power, I'd recommend the old standard internal combustion style mower.Highly recommended if you don't mind power cord maintenance.Pros:Quiet (compared to regular engine mowers)No gas smell on clothes, hair, bodyLightPowerfulSingle, easy point to adjust heightCons:CordCordCordCan give impression of not being powerful"

The problem with the pad, of course, is that you have to get up before moving to a new spot.  It is much easier to garden with the knee pads attached to your legs.  I am very pleased with this purchase.I am attaching a photo under customer photos that I will be referencing in this review.The photo shows both sides of the knee pads.  The top image shows the outer shell of the pad that touches the ground. It is made out of thick (slight under 1/2 inch) rubberized material which provides cushioning and protection from moisture.The bottom image show the inside part of the knee pad, which is made with soft black non-slippery material.  The cavity of the knee pad is 4.75 inches wide, and 7 inches long. It can be made more narrow by tightening the knee straps or wider by pressing on it with the knee because it flexes.Each knee pad has a rubber band which holds the knee pad to the leg. Each band is 20 inches long and 1.5 inches wide.  At each end of the rubber band there is 3.5 inches of Velcro so you can adjust the pad based on the size of your leg.  If your legs are particularly skinny you can sew in additional Velcro strip so you can close it tighter.  If your legs are thicker you can add another piece of rubber band with more Velcro.  I consider myself an average size woman and I got a perfect fit with and without long pants on.The knee pads are easy to clean by washing them with a hose.  They are solidly made and feel like a good quality item.Fiskars offers lifetime warranty for the knee pads.  Even if when I don't plan  on using a warranty replacement, it always makes me feel good about a product when the company shows the confidence in the product by offering such long warranty.  For warranty service, email warranty@fiskars.com or call 1-866-348-5661 or contact Fiskars Brands, Inc. 2537 Daniels Street, Madison, WI 53718.I am really enjoying my knee pads, in particular because I can move so much easier with them than a knee pad I used before.

After finishing my preliminary work, I went inside to use the computer for an hour.  Then, on walking to another part of the house, realized they were still on.  That's comfortable.  I'm average build, male.  No problems with the velcro."

Also if you are working  on the ground with a lot of dirt, some of the dirt tends to get inside the knee pads, so sometimes to have to stop to shake it out.  I would probably buy this product again."

I couldn't really tell from the pictures, but once I inspected and held it, I could feel the quality and after testing it, I noticed a huge difference, the way it handles dirt/soil and the little work it takes to dig, is simply great.What I like the most is the design, the handle is a  solid metal piece, thick and extremely durable. It didn't bend while digging and it felt very comfortable. The handle is wrapped in a rubberized sleeve which happens to be very ergonomic.Nothing much to say really. This is great gardening tool that I'm sure will last."

        "text": "I use this heavily to till the soil in my flower beds because of its broad shoulders and sharp point.  Although its used mostly for troweling, it's  narrow enough to be used for planting and broad enough for transplanting.  I have a tool for every job but I find this is the only digging tool I really need to bring along.  If you're debating which type of  hand digger to get (planter, transplanter, troweler, etc.), I would stick with this trowelerThe handle is very comfortable, important when jabbing it into the ground repeatedly to loosen the soil.  The wooden tools I've used in the past have been very hard on my hands but, I come away with no pain with this design.The polished alumnium is VERY strong, light weight, mostly scratch resistant and does not rust.  The textured material on the handle does collect dirt and has to be scrubbed to get clean."
