When the cuttings are ready to move into a larger container, they can easily be lifted out of the potting mix without damaging the newly formed roots.We also will mix the Perlite with compost, soil, quarter minus gravel, and bark dust to form a planting mix.  Place the larger rhododendrons directly on the top of the mix on the ground. No need to dig a large hole. We live in the Pacific Northwest and have heavy clay soil. You do not want to place rhododendrons in a hole in the ground. Mix the planting mix and place the larger rhody plants on top of it. Mulch around the sides of the plant with bark dust.  Rhododendrons are shallow rooted plants and will develop a fine web of roots growing into this planting mix.Following this planting method, your rhododendrons will thrive for many years. We have seen some that at 63 years old!"

These work great if you are making your own seed-starting or potting soil mix.  I find that they help a great deal in modulating the moisture content and drainage; also in avoiding compaction.  You can find lots of soil mix recipes, but roughly a one-third perlite mix does very well for my uses."

It consists of small puff like white balls that absorb the moisture and hold it for a time.  It is much better than regular soil in that it does hold the water for a longer period of time, allowing the plant to gradually suck the water from the material.  Yes, it does work, and the fertilizer built in does help keep the plant healthy. Since you are mixing it with regular potting soil, even though you don't get that much in your bag, it does go a long way.  I think it is really designed for interior plants, but it should work outside (I have only used it inside on plants)."

        "text": "Perlite (any brand) is designed to improve drainage and aeration in soil.  It's white and lightweight - Using it ensures that your soil will drain better as it adds air pockets.  More air pockets = more root growth.There is no exact science of how much perlite to use with your soil - I would suggest for every 2-3 scoops of soil, you add a scoop of perlite.  If you add more perlite than what I suggest, it's not going to hurt anything, you may simply find that you have to water more frequently since your soil mixture will drain really quickly and may dry out faster.As with all Miracle-Gro products, this Perlite provides a small amount of fertilizer (.07 each of Nitrogen - promotes top growth, Phosphate - promotes healthy roots and Potash - promotes abundant fruits and flowers).  I view the Miracle-Gro fertilizer addition as basically a &#34;starter&#34; fertilizer.  It doesn't eliminate your need to fertilize in the future, it merely provides some of the basic nutrients throughout the 1st few watering; you'll then need to research your plant's nutritional needs and fertilize as  recommended.On a side note, I would strongly suggest that if your order this at Amazon, be VERY careful while opening your box.  Mine fit perfectly in the box (with virtually no extra space) and I nearly nicked the bag with a knife while cutting open the box which would have lead to a HUGE mess.  Lastly, this product can often be found for less than $5-6 for an 8 qt bag so it might be worth shopping around.  Happy Gardening!"

        "text": "I'm a believer in the benefits of using perlite. It helps keep soil from compacting, giving roots the best opportunity to thrive. I grow a lot of flowering annuals that I primarily begin from cuttings. Blooming plants add more to my home than any piece of furniture ever could and I love that family and friends love them as gifts.You can find perlite in a range of prices depending on whether it's organic and/or contains nutrients. For the most part, I use the less expensive, non-enriched stuff, about $25 for a 4 cubic foot bag (about 120 US quarts).At $5 for 8 quarts, the same amount of Miracle-Gro's perlite with nutrients would cost around $75. It pays to figure out which stuff to use when.For example, if I am given cuttings or seedlings that still need to establish roots, I like to use the more expensive, nutrient enriched perlite and Miracle Gro is my go-to brand. When it's time to transplant, I use a high quality soil (FoxFarm FX14000 1-1/2-Cubic Feet FoxFarm Ocean Forest Organic Soilis a personal fav) mixed with the cheaper plain old perlite.When I transplant, I transplant into a new container that is not too much bigger than the old one. When I see roots are ready to emerge from the new pot, I transplate it into the next size up. If the plant is going to eventually end up in an 8 gallon container, for example, I will transplant it 3 or 4 times to get it there. I get that doing multiple transplants isn't for everyone, and maybe I'm fooling myself, but I believe my plants grow bigger and faster doing it this way.The point of this, regarding perlite, is that the more expensive stuff isn't necessary when transplanting so often. The soil contains all the nutrients needed for the amount of time a plant is in each container. It isn't until I move the plant into the container in which it will eventually bloom and live out its life, that I pop for the more expensive perlite.From that point, I alternate feeding the plant plain water or a mixture of nutrients based on stage of growth (FoxFarm FX14006 1-Quart FoxFarm Grow Big Liquid Concentrate 6-4-4for example). My formula mix is heavy with nitrogen at first to grow the plant big and green and then gets switched up when budding starts and again when flowers bloom. All along, the Miracle-Gro provides any necessary \"back up\" nutrients during the water only feedings. Plus roots stay happy in non-compacting soil.I also do not pop for the more expensive perlite when storing bulbs. Water is what releases the nutrients in enriched perlite. Bulbs are stored dry, so I save the bucks when I can.Miracle-Gro's perlite is my brand for the nutrient enriched. It has proven itself to me year after year, and I stick with what's proven successful."

I got them from a lady at a farmers market awhile back, and the soil mix that she had used was full of perlite, making it very light.  Strepto culture is about the same as for African Violets, so I purchased some bagged soil mix for violets [without added plant food].  It was somewhat dense, however, and I lost a couple of my smaller streptocarpus plants.  I have since started adding about 20 to 25% Miracle Gro perlite to the mix.  The soil in my pots is light and porous, and so far, my Streps are loving it.  Since the Miracle Gro Perlite contains fertilizer, I do not add any additional plant food.  The doctored soil mix is now very much like what was used in the original plantings that I bought.  I also have a few African Violets, so I think I will repot those with the new mixture very soon.

I feel this will be a good starter for my seedlings, though I will add some of the slow acting fertilizer as well. Only time will tell if this is a good combination, but I am confident it will work well. The Perlite  helps to hold moisture so that the seedlings do not dry out so easily. I use peat pots which must be checked almost daily anyway.The sieve I use is just a wood frame about 12&#34; by 18&#34; with a piece of 1/2&#34; firm mesh nailed to it securely. The whole mixture is mixed in a old plastic storage container about the same top dimensions of the sieve.I use, by volume, about 2 parts top soil, 1 part peat moss, a shake or two of granular fertilizer and about 1/4 part Perlite. If soil is needed for more acid loving seedlings I use more peat moss or add a acid fertilizer or aluminum sulfate. I use the addition of  lime for a more alkaline soil. Though my garden is primarily an organic garden, I found for best results and ease of growing from seeds before planting in the garden, especially flowers, that the added fertilizer is fine for my needs.

        "text": "Perlite is a naturally occurring substance that is commonly used with potted plants to prevent soil compaction. It can also be used improve drainage and promote strong root development. You can also use it to store bulbs and root crops by pouring it around them and not packing or watering.The amount you use should depend on the particular plant. With rarer plants, chances are that you can find a website that gives a soil recipe saying how much to use in proportion to anything else. The bag says that this 8 QT bag will fill two eight inch pots, so that should give an idea how much perlite you will get.Miracle-Gro's brand also contains their plant food. Previously it had total Nitrogen is 0.04%, Available phosphate is 0.01% and Soluble potash is 0.06%. The bag I just got lists 0.07% each for all three. Although I've had very good results with their plant food, I'm not sure if there's a big advantage to having it integrated since you could add it on your own and I would recommend having a supply on hand. Nevertheless, it probably couldn't hurt. I say \"probably\" because there are some rare tropical plants and probably others that survive on very little nutrients and can be damaged by additives. Nevertheless, I have used this (previous formula) with Nepenthes Ventrata without any problems, and that's a species that's more sensitive to soil balance and more likely to be harmed by the wrong additives than most common house plants.For more typical houseplants, there should be no worries. Miracle-Gro is a leader in plant food and their website has a lot of helpful information on how to use their various products. The instructions on the bag give steps for use with root cuttings and for storing bulbs and root crops. They don't go into specifics for general use and there are a lot of guidelines from horticulturalists but they tend to vary. But it boils down to taking some perlite and other potting soil and mixing it together.  In most cases, somewhere between 25% and 50% will be appropriate. There are even some who grow things in 100% perlite, but I have found that 20-25% works well for me with house plants and a higher ratio works well for vegetable plants.Previously, this came in a bag that was easy to reseal, with a \"Ziploc\" style closure. This new one comes in an easy open non-resealable bag. It's not much of a criticism, but that's a step down from what they had before."

        "text": "Nobody who grows house plants should be without Perlite.  For YEARS I thought this stuff was Styrofoam, but of course its not. Perlite is a type of volcanic rock, that has been heated up until is expands. (The rock pops open like popcorn.) Adding perlite to your soil, keeps it from getting too compacted, as well as aiding in drainage.  Perlite helps to keep oxygen in the soil, and air, which the roots need to stay healthy. The biggest cause of death for a typical house plant isn't lack of water, but overwatering.  Add in lack of drainage to overly watered plants, and you get root rot--fast. Since perlite wont hold moisture, its also good for storing plant bulbs.  People also use it to start cuttings, tho I don't.  MIRACLE GRO perlite has their famous fertilizer added.  The price for this bag is cheap, compared to the box stores, and since its available as an ADD ON purchase, you don't have to worry about added shipping. This is perfect for city plant lovers, who might not live near a home depot type store, or gardening center. (Or who don't have the time to go get it even if they did.)You can save a LOT of money if you just make your own potting soil.  I buy the CHEAP potting soil, a dollar a bag, that's just loam, pure black. That type of potting soil is so dense, that most plants would just drown in the constantly wet, poor draining loam. So, just add about one part perlite, to 3 parts potting soil.  Adding a little bit of vermiculite can make the soil retain water, without getting too dense.  People who spend a lot of money for cactus and palm soils are crazy.  Make your own with one part loam, (or ground up coconut shells), one part perlite, and one part vermiculite.  Maybe throw in a little bit of sand too, for very water intolerant cacti. That mix will give you a fast draining soil,  without retaining too much water, which would quickly kill cacti.Perlite tends to FLOAT TO THE TOP OF YOUR SOIL. Its so light, that when you add water to your potting mix, it floats up thru the loam and vermiculite.  The ONLY solution to that, is to put a thin later of very small pebbles on top of your soil. If you are talking about bonsai plants, you might want to avoid perlite, and use fine sized lava rocks, or turface (baked clay) to keep your soil from compacting. Because even if you DO place pebbles on top of your Perlite soils, you will still get that stuff floating up thru the dirt."

Once the seedlings are well-established, then I transplant outside.I used this mix to start some Papaver somniferum (annual poppies), and it worked as well as anything I've tried in the past.The reason there is a special mix for seed-starting (as opposed to regular potting mix) is that the fertilizer should be a little weaker, so it doesn't burn the delicate roots of seedlings.Because I could not find the ingredients on this product page or anywhere else online, I took a photo; you'll find it in the consumer photos. It's mostly sphagnum peat, with some perlite.As another reviewer mentioned, the mix is a little heavy on the peat for my tastes. It's easy enough to add perlite or vermiculate, another moisture-enhancing soil amendment, if you have it. Perlite looks like little white styrofoam balls, but it is actually a very porous volcanic material that resembles pumice.  It helps avoid soil compaction, improves aeration, and retains moisture, but it promotes better drainage than vermiculite.Whether or not you want to add perlite depends on the container and environment in which you are starting the seeds (e.g. the air temperature, humidity, amount of sunlight, etc.) as well as the kind of plants you are growing. Some love having their \"feet wet\"; some don't.Overall, this seems a good medium for starting most seeds. The important thing is not over- or under-watering.Happy sprouting!"

        "text": "When I received this and opened the box I was hit with the most wonderful smell: peat (okay, so maybe I'm weird, but I love the smell of peat).  And that's pretty much what this product is: 85-95% peat (my bag is probably on the high end of that range).  There is also a little perlite, a *very small* amount of chemical fertilizers (.03-.03-.03), and wetting agents to make the peat absorb water easier.  For the people who complained about lots of sticks it's probably coming from the peat - if you buy a bag of peat you generally get a lot of naturally occurring debris.Still, it worked pretty well for me.  The fertilizers are light enough to give a small boost to seedlings without burning them.  I think I might have preferred that it have worm castings added, but that's just my preference.  The peat still took a while to absorb water so the wetting agents are pretty light as well, but it was definitely easier and quicker than plain peat.  And being so heavy on peat, it didn't dry out quickly.  Overall, a nice product for seed-starting or cuttings."

I thought this would be interesting to try:  A potting soil with some miracle gro mixed in.  It's pretty lightweight stuff - the soil in this bag packs down considerably when you are using it to plant a seedling in a small pot.  But, it is only five bucks.  And for that five bucks, you get some very fine soil with little dots of miracle gro mixed in.  It almost looks like styrofoam bits in dirt.  I've used this to plant flowers as well as some scallions, and they seem to be doing well.  I haven't done a side-by-side comparison with regular dirt, but this is priced right and saves me the trouble of having to add miracle gro on it's own."

        "text": "I compared this to some commercial growth medium from a local nursery, with tomato seeds planted in each. Worked great, no difference in germination or initial growth I could see.I'm also using it in a mix I made for the seedlings once they got started. At about an inch-and-a-half tall I put the seedlings in larger containers. There's only very light fertilizer in this starter mix, .03 - .03 - .03 NPK, to avoid burning the new roots, so for more fertilizer I used a 50/50 mix of this andMiracle-Gro Moisture Control Potting Mix(.21 - .11 - .16 NPK). The extra water retention is also helpful, since seedlings are very sensitive to drying out. That 50/50 mix is the top couple inches of soil. Below that I putMiracle-Gro Garden Soil for Flower and Vegetable, since we don't plant tomatoes outside here until June, and it will set the roots in something a little more suitable for outdoors.The seedlings are doing great in that mixture, with more than twice as much leaf growth as the seedlings that are in the same size containers with the local nursery medium. (When they go into the ground outside they'll get less nitrogen in the fertilizer. Keep in mind that the NPK composition of growth medium and soil cannot be directly compared to that of fertilizer additives, which are a lot more concentrated so they can be diluted in the soil.)The main ingredient is listed as 85-95% sphagnum peat moss, and my bag appears to be about 95%, with few twigs, and just a bit of perlite. The package says it also includes a wetting agent (to help soak in water), along with the light fertilizer listed above."

It absorbed a LOT of water and held onto it for well over 24 hours, so keeping my seeds moist was easy. The bag didn't seem to go far because the fluffy &#34;soil&#34; compressed quite a lot in the pots, but it isn't terribly expensive so it is still a good value. Germination was less than 60% and I expected better because I used absolutely fresh seeds. The germination failures may have been the result of other factors, so I can't confidently attribute them to this mix. I discovered that my heating pad was running a little high for a couple of days. I have remedied that now and my results on the second batch of seedlings will be available in a few days. I will update soon.The problems with gnats or other small insects and damping off that plagued last year's mix according to old reviews on the prior listing did not occur with this bag.This may be a 5-star product, but I won't upgrade my rating until I'm certain that the germination problem came from elsewhere. At this point, I give a moderately enthusiastic recommendation."

So you'll  find those of us with farmer-genes huddled around our gardening benches in the basement trying to urge on seedlings, as though our efforts will make spring come a little bit earlier.There is nothing like plopping a seed in warm, rich Miracle-Gro Seed Starting Potting Mix, wetting the dirt till damp, then setting it under a bright,sun-shine infused warming lamp. I just step back, sip a hot cup-a-something and watch that seed grow.Okay, so I may have painted a slightly unrealistic picture.

This 2014's batch is down to .03% NPK and no iron. It doesn't make much difference to me since I'm an inexact, casual gardener, but I thought I'd share the numbers in case it matters to someone. 2013's packaging also had a resealable zip closure to the top of the bag which is missing in 2014's.I like Miracle-Gro's mix because it's light and what's put in a pot and moistened basically turns into one collective dirt sponge. I tend to knock pots over with my makeshift trays, etc. If it's a pot with regular soil that I just popped some seeds into, everything crumbles and tumbles everywhere making me have to redo everything. The pots that I've knocked over with the Miracle-Gro in it have more or less stayed intact with no dirt crumbles or seeds falling out. My seedlings are growing well so far, and I haven't had any mite or gnat issues arising from the soil."

I use my hose all over the yard, about 180 degrees around and it was always hard for me to yank it over to where I need it. I love that this reel swivels around but locks if I want.

While this is fairly heavy-duty, I found that using &#34;light duty&#34; or &#34;medium duty&#34; hoses worked best, as the heavy duty variety don't like to bend in quite a small of a diameter as this gives.  As long as your hose isn't rigid as some heavy duty ones are, you should be able to reel it up easily.Assembly:  it was easy, but the little wrench thing that's included didn't even fit the nuts.  At least the manual even suggests you may need to use your own pliers.Overall, this looks nice, is solid, and based on limited usage thus far, is a quality product.  It would've been nice if it would have some with mounting hardware (come on, it's four screws and you're charging over 100 bucks...); I'm not convinced, even after having this, that I would buy it again based on price alone.  Good unit, but feels pricey compared to other options."

Over the year we've own expensive ones that looked great but wore out far too fast, cheap ones that we planned to toss after each year but which performed so badly we still didn't get out money's worth, moderate ones that seemed to be the worst of all possible worlds...too expensive to toss out and inferior in almost every way. We store one hose in a hose bucket/basket which is less unsightly but still a pain to wind. We have a couple portable reels that are more trouble than they are worth. When this came up for review I thought 'what the heck'....so very glad to try this out!First, this is smartly designed. Really like the added shelf to store accessories which often end up in the shed and out of reach or laying in windowsills. Next, the heft and weight are much more substantial than most...combined with a powder coating, this FEELs far superior to most hose reels.Size is terrific - holds ample hose length for the average homeowner. Function is superb - easy to use handle that is ergonomically stable PLUS (and this is a big one) a built-in swivel so the hose goes where you need it to go with less effort.Stable - you will need to secure this to the house or other designated area but comes complete with brackets. All in all, VERY impressive! Finally an attractive, functional and easy to use hose reel."

        "text": "May 20, 2014 UpdateI see my review of this product has received no positive and one negative opinions so far. It is my experience that people tend to like positive reviews more than negative reviews. But I count on consumer comments here on Amazon and I want to know what's good and perhaps not so good when I buy an item. Not being shy I'll add to my review with a little more detail.We have now used this hose reel daily for over a month. In general this is a decent hose reel but I have one issue with it. It is a little hard to crank.If you are a young strong person this will not be an issue for you. I am 67 years old and I feel as if I'm working out at the gym when I roll the hose up with this Liberty Garden 710. I believe this is due to two design characteristics.1) The reel itself has a little tension. There is a tension adjust screw which I have backed out all the way, and even have tried removing the tension adjust screw altogether. Perhaps other copies of this reel don't have as much tension. It isn't really tight. It's just enough not to be free wheeling.2) The length of the handle bar, which connects the handle to the center of the hose reel, is a bit short which provides less leverage than would be comfortable for my wife and I. The handle doesn't even extend to the outer edge of the reel. There is plenty of room for a longer handle if Liberty wants to make a design change.As a comparison we have a different hose reel in our front yard. That reel (mentioned below) has zero tension on it with the lock off. Also the handle is mounted on the outer edge of the reel (and that unit has a larger reel diameter) so there is quite a bit more leverage. We find that unit easy to use.So if you don't mind the effort required to use this Liberty Garden 710 then you should be pleased with it. However if you're like my wife and I you may find this just a bit too much effort to use on a daily basis. We have 75' of 5/8\" hose on this reel. We pull it out daily to water flowers in our typical 100+ degree low humidity weather. When we roll the hose up we aren't rolling up with the whole 75' being pulled by the reel. We normally only pull out about 50 feet of hose, then, when we're done watering, we double back to the reel with the hose end in our hand. So we are only pulling 25 feet of hose at most.March 22 updateI did install the reel today. I am concerned about it's use for three reasons.1) It is stiff to wind up the hose. That may improve with time.2) Compared to the plastic reel it replaced (that failed) it protrudes much further from the wall which puts more tension on the bracket. I'm afraid it is going to pull out from the wall. If it does it will be my fault for not using more substantial hardware to install it I guess.3) As I said earlier it has no lock to hold the hose in place when it is reeled in. Perhaps the design makes the hose stiff to reel in so it won't turn too freely, presumably then not requiring a lock.It is my wife, the gardener, who will have the final say. I will leave this review at 4 stars so far as these are just my concerns. Actual use may be better than my first impressions.We have an Eley / Rapid Reel Wall Mount Garden Hose Reel Model 1041 in the front yard which we are very pleased with. If this Liberty doesn't work out we will buy a second Eley.Eley / Rapid Reel Wall Mount Garden Hose Reel Model 1041ORIGINAL REVIEW...We've had a cheap plastic hose reel in our back yard for about a year. It has worked well but sometimes the whole reel pops off, due to a faulty latch design, and sprays water everywhere. When Amazon offered this Liberty 710 free as part of the Amazon Vine program I snatched it up as a replacement for our cheap plastic reel.Upon opening the box I was pleased by two things about the Liberty 710.1) The entire hose reel consists of two main parts, a handle to be installed, Two screws and nuts, and a leader hose. I really appreciate the design which resulted in very view parts to deal with. The shelf part is installed on a wall without having the weight of the hose reel itself attached. Then attaching the reel is accomplished by simply sliding it into slots on the shelf, then using two screws to hold it in place. The instructions, clear with ample drawings, are easy to understand and follow.2) The materials and construction are of good quality. I wasn't expecting the smoothness of the power coat finish. The steel material seems to be heavy enough last a long time, while not being so heavy as to be difficult to handle. The included leader hose seems to be sturdy with brass fittings.One major concern is there is no lock to keep the reel from turning when the hose is stored. Ideally one would approach the reel, unlock the reel, and pull the hose out for use. Then when finished one would turn the handle to roll up the hose, followed by locking the reel. There is no such lock on the Liberty 710. There is a tension screw but that means if you apply sufficient tension to keep the reel from spinning then it would also be resistant to pulling the hose off the reel for use.Another concern is rust if and when the powder coat is scrapped to the metal level. A substantial aluminum design would be my preference. At least a power coat is superior to a spray paint coating."

        "text": "This is a great garden hose reel--attractive design, well-crafted and sturdy, and with the added functionality of rotation so that you are never kinking your hose. It comes with a piece of hose that attaches directly to your hydrant, so that the water travels through it and into a contacting tube made into the reel itself before entering your actual hose pipe. Therefore this isn't just a reel that does nothing but hold your hosepipe, it actually becomes part of the hose pipe and makes it easier to use. It's a great product.However, I was amazed by the weight of it. We really had to make sure it was securely fastened to the wall for me to feel comfortable tugging on the hose pipe even a little bit. If you think of the weight of the product itself (23 pounds) plus the weight of the hose pipe that you will have hanging on it, then that makes for one very heavy item hanging on your wall. Think closely about what wall you will be able to hang this on prior to your purchase. We ended up using an extra board underneath the bracket just to give it some extra support."

The Liberty Garden 710 Navigator Garden Hose Reel is definitely an upgrade up from my old plastic reel system, which I really loved as well since it lasted for 12 years or so. Installation was a bit tricky, but I reeled through it (pun intended). I bought a new hose to use with it that was much shorter than my old hose, and more flexible, and in the long run I think this was a great decision on my hand and future buyers should do. I like the little shelf on top as well, as I place my other hose accessories on it, as well as my watering can. Yes, it has no lock and will droop unless you place the hose nozzle up top, but that is no biggie. Overall, I see this lasting many years, and its a great investment at the price level, so I recommend it to all."

        "text": "I had the Liberty Garden Wall Mounted Hose Reel Antique Finish 704 on the wall prior to installing this one. I moved the 704 to the rear hose bibb on my house and mounted this 710 model one to the front. I needed to be able to rotate the hose reel 90 degrees toward the driveway.Let me say that the 704 model has been my favorite hose reel ever. I had gotten so tired of those plastic reels that go on the ground, then I went thru a plastic reel on the wall. These aluminum reels have been great! I used some 3&#34; deep masonry anchors to mount it to the brick foundation on my home. Installation took about 20 minutes, but it is rock solid. You do want to make sure that it is well secured and leveled especially if you are going to use 125 feet of hose. If you will be mounting it to siding you will want to make sure to mount it wall studs. The mounting holes are spaced 16&#34; apart to land on standard stud spacings. At a minimum I would make sure the right side which is where the crank handle is located, is on a stud.I have a 125 foot hose and was a little concerned that it would not fit on this new reel. The 704 model has a reel that is about 4 inches wider that this 710 model. However this 710 model is deeper and did just hold all 125 feet. I would recommend that you use a lesser length like 100 ft or 75 ft if you can as it is much easier to reel in.The fit and finish on these are great. I've had my other reel for well over a couple of years and it has not rusted at all. The finish has faded slightly but not too terribly. I may take the hose out and mask and spray paint a new finish on it next year if needed.To rotate the reel use need to pull up on the large knob at the center of the front edge of the top of the platform. This will raise a downward facing locking pin that will disengage from a hole slot in the reel mounting plate and allow you to pick another hole. There are 4 holes which allow you to choose 90 degree increments. I guess in a pinch you could add your own custom angles by drilling extra holes in the plate. I may try this.Overall I don't think you will be disappointed is either Liberty Garden Hose Reels as they are well made and designed. Finally, a long lasting hose reel!5 stars easy!"

And the rotating feature will let me move my hose around to different parts of my yard so much more easily.The back brackets are just over 10 inches long so they fit perfectly and lie flat on my 1950s cedar shakes.  If you have smaller siding, you might have more trouble getting it to sit right on the siding.  (The installation instructions contemplate a flat wall.) The reel pieces go on after you fasten the bracket piece so you don't have to hold the whole thing while you fasten it to the wall.Speaking of fastening, this product does not come with the screws necessary to mount it on your wall.  So it would be a good idea to go out and get the screws while you wait for this to arrive.  The manufacturer recommends (4) 7 or 8 mm lag screws with washers (5/16\" x 2 1/2\") for a flat wood frame wall.  For a brick masonry wall they suggest (4) 7 or 8 mm x 60 mm masonry wall anchors, (4) anchor sleeves, (4) washers, (4) lock washers, and (4) nuts.I am slightly concerned about how this metal hose reel will hold up in Minnesota weather.  However, the manufacturer suggests the hose reel part be taken off and stored indoors or sealed in a plastic container over the winter.  That just leaves the bracket to worry about."

I don't think you could mount this on cinder block or any of the thinner wooden fencing. This can be a problem as you obviously want it close to a spigot.The unit is VERY heavy. This is both good and bad. Good in that it is not a piece of junk, bad in that you need some serious support to hold it while you yank a hose out of it.I like the tray, great for an extra nozzle or hose splitter.We put a maxflow hose that is only 50 feet so lots of spare room on the winding wheel.Kind of a bummer that there is no auto retraction, but-- hey, it is very attractive and much nicer than the two plastic units I have."

It held our heavy-duty 100-foot hose with room to spare and the wind is easy to reel back in.As others have noted, there is no reel lock, so the hose tends to droop a bit, but not more than 2-3' feet and can be mitigated with a tuck of the end into the rest of the hose. (Though even that occasionally falls out.) All in all, while not ideal, this isn't a major gripe for me.Overall, this is well-made item that does exactly what it says it will and looks good doing it. My hope is that it will prove as durable as the construction quality seems to indicate."

I like that it swivels.  One thing I wish it would've come with is the hardware for attaching to the masonry, and or wall studs.  I had to go to the hardware store and buy them.  Hoping to avoid that.  But, oh, well.You will have to attach this unit to your wall studs, which is always a challenge since you can't find studs using a stud finder.  So, you have to use the old Poke-N-Hope method.  Take a masonry bit, (small one).  Drill a hole and then see if you get resistance.  If you don't find resistance, then you haven't hit the stud.  Repeat until you find the stud, then you can attach to the stucco wall."

        "text": "This is my favorite of the Perky-Pet Hummingbird Feeders that I own. This is my second favorite feeder afterSchrodt Designs Model HBL-B Cobalt Hummingbird Feederto which this is very similar. Let me first describe this feeder and then give you a quick compare and contrast .The nectar holder is clear glass cylinder. Build seems good; there is no description of safety glass so I assume it would shatter if broken. Both ends screw off for easy filling and cleaning of the glass cylinder. Just place the flat end down, fill with a solution of 1 part Baker's Sugar Ultrafine Pure Cane Sugar (found at your supermarket) to 3-4 parts tap water. Screw on the hummingbird feeder basin while the glass cylinder is still upside down. Then screw on the top of the feeder keeping the feeder upside down. Turn the feeder over to release the sugar water into the basin. And hang. Simple. If you spill some sugar water in the process, a light rinse before hanging will help prevent attracting ants and other critters.The basin is plastic surrounded by a metal wire for the hummingbirds to perch while taking a more relaxing drink. We live in the hot desert. I like that the basin is plastic: easier to clean, DOES NOT HEAT the water and is protected from the sun by a sturdy metal base cover with bright red \"flower\" feeding ports. I'm sorry that the perch metal wire around the basin is metal. I've noticed from other models of our Perky-Pet feeders and this too that the hummers don't like holding on to a metal perch in the heat of the sun. But they will sit early in the morning and in the late dusk hour.I like the large reinforced metal wire loop at the top of the feeder--easy to hang and it's not going to break even in brisk weather.The copper color is painted on. It seems like a nice paint and ours has a few spots missing and smudged but the hummers will never notice nor will I unless the feeder is in shade and I'm 8 inches away scrutinizing. It's fine.Comparisons to the Schrodt Design Schrodt Designs Model HBL-B Cobalt Hummingbird FeederVery Similar -- I prefer Schrodt's colored curved glass. It's much lovelier and elegant and probably keeps the 7 oz of sugar water they hold from heating up in the sun. You get bacteria growth from sunlight on sugar water. Whenever you notice the water getting cloudy, something floating in the water or the birds not feeding like they use to, you probably have bacteria growth and need to clean your feeder well. In these instances I will clean them with bleach water and rinse 3 times. One also should find an alternate location more shaded to move the feeder. This may be easier for you but it's kindof hard out here in the land of the sun. The nice design with this Perky-Pet Hummingbird Feeder is that the little hat provides some sun protection--maybe. The Schrodt feeders are copper and redwood. After 6 years of constant use they do not leak when hanging and I am careful with a quick rinse if I spill any when I turn it upside down. They are pieces of Art and at just over $36 whereas this is half the price. Good Value, Perky-Pets! The Schrodt design is harder to clean but again in 6 years, I've probably had bacteria growth floating in water in the Schrodt design, maybe 4 times over 3 feeders in nearly full sun.This is our 8th feeder. We have lots of hummingbirds and we plant to attact them. This feeder is a winner."

It was a glass bottle version with wood ends and a plastic insert. Over the years, we tried other feeders but never found another that performed as well. We moved a few years ago and have not bothered to set up a feeder in our new place.This feeder is well constructed and attractive. It is glass with metal ends surrounding plastic threaded caps. It is easy to fill and clean. The old feeder required a long bottlebrush to clean, and even then it was difficult to keep the very top clean. This accommodates a larger brush and is easier to keep clean. It also holds a reasonable amount of liquid. Some people may think larger capacity is better, but it is preferable to refill and clean the feeder more often. In addition, hummingbirds are territorial, and it is unlikely that more than one will feed at a time.The nectar is easy to use: just add 8 ounces of water and mix. No boiling is required and the solution dissolved quickly. I will go back to my old water and sugar solution but I enjoyed trying the included sample packet."

Feeding the birds, watching them flit and fly around my feeders and trees is one of my biggest life pleasures.  It&#8217;s calming, relaxing and the birds are beautiful.Hummingbirds are slowly starting to come around my house since I got my first hummingbird feeder last year.  I am hoping with the addition of this one, it will get the hummingbirds talking and heading to my place breakfast lunch and dinner.  I am starting to strategically place my feeders so that I can enjoy them in both my front and back yards.  It&#8217;s been a little chilly and I haven&#8217;t yet seen any hummingbirds, but I remain hopeful.In Michigan we have really harsh winters and hot summers and I kept a few feeders out through the winter for the birds who brave our winters, they look as good as new.  I will definitely continue to use the Perky Pet line of feeders.Cherise Everhard, May 2014"

I do have a couple of areas of concern, that may prove to be baseless, and these (along with the highlights) are listed below.What I liked about this feeder:1. The mouth of the feeder is wide enough to pour the nectar in with ease.2. Both ends screw off on this feeder, so clean up is a breeze. *3. The glass tube is thick so this part of the feeder should last for ages.4. The feeder looks very nice, not overly garish.5. The bee guards are a great idea.6. The 12 ounce capacity makes refilling less of a hassle.My concerns:1. While the 12 ounce capacity is nice, I am worried that mold will be an issue if the humming birds are not feeding frequently. (I only filled the unit a quarter full and am going to monitor how quickly the nectar goes before increasing the amount I put in - we are early days for humming birds right now.)2. Rust - these sorts of feeders are always prone to rusting, time will tell if this is an issue with this particular unit.3. Color - I really do not like overly garish feeders but we all know that humming birds are attracted to flash, this unit is on the elegant side and time will tell if it has enough brightness to attract the birds.Recommended with above reservations.*The totally unintentional rhyming ends here - you are welcome."

This feeder has some built in bee guards that protect from bees and a tiny ant guard which protects from wandering ants.  So far I have not been bothered by either when using this feeder.The feeder is an attractive copper with a glass bottle.  The bottle has a wide mouth for easy filling and the feeder comes with an initial supply of Perky Pet.  The bottom of my feeder is indeed removable and comes apart to clean the internals.  However, the bottom is plastic and does not stay connected unless I use the originally supplied twist ties to keep it affixed.  This also leads to some leakage over time.Overall &#8211; this is a very attractive feeder that is well-liked by the hummers.  My biggest issue is the design of the base and keeping the metal portion connected to the plastic bottom.  Other than that&#8230;this is a great upgrade for a traditional all-plastic feeder."

It cleans up easily and actually sits flat on the counter so that you can easily fill it up with nectar.

Cleaning requires unscrewing the top and bottom from a clear glass tube and hand washing with warm soapy water twice a week.  Then screw the feeder base with bee guards onto the glass tube, add up to 12 oz/355 ml nectar, screw the top on, and hang the feeder in an easily visible area.The Perky Pet 710B hummingbird feeder is the first feeder I've owned or attempted to use.  After a month, I've yet to see a hummingbird and the nectar level hasn't changed.  A week in and I started to wonder what I was doing wrong.  Between Perky Pet's companion website and some advice from friends, I learned that hummingbirds are territorial, have poor eyesight, and are attracted to bright red and orange colors.  Perky Pet's interactive hummingbird migration map also verified sightings in my area.  After learning this, I started looking at plants for the yard which might help attract hummingbirds and relocated the feeder from a secluded area off the back porch to a more visible spot outside my kitchen window.Even though I've yet to feed a hummingbird, I can't blame the Perky Pet 710B hummingbird feeder.  This feeder is simple to clean, fill, and maintain, not to mention easy on the eyes.  If you're looking for a stylish hummingbird feeder, I highly recommend the Perky Pet 710B hummingbird feeder.PROS:Simple to clean and fillBee guards protect nectar from bees and wasps12 month limited warrantyCONS:None I could find"

You have a place to add the nectar, a place where the birds sip and a way to hang it.  This feeder excels in all the areas.  First, it's compact in size (measuring just under 11 inches and not including the substantial wire hanger - and just under 7inches at the circular bird perch).  The column of thick glass holds 12oz of the bird nectar and is MUCH easier to pour in because the mouth is wider than previous models I've had.The Brushed Copper is well done but know, the bottom is plastic (what the glass tube screws into) but it's out of site and makes the feeder able to be under 2 lbs.I really like the looks of this feeder and the steel hook is ideal.

I realize they are bee guards, and they seem to be doing their job; I just wish they would have made them in some other material and/or color. I'm a firm believer that if you have hummers in your area, your feeders need not have anything red on them (or in them...powdered food!), because they will come. It's so easy to make your own humming bird food (1:4 sugar/water ratio ~ Google it:) ~  I have this hanging on my farmer's porch where it's not totally exposed to the elements so the copper should hold up.Literally, within 15 minutes of putting this feeder up, I had a gorgeous male Ruby Red Throat at the feeder, squeaking away while he was eating. I admit, I didn't think they would come it *that* quickly, because it usually takes a bit of time for them to get used to any new feeders.This is a nice addition to my collection, pretty to look at, easy to clean, and feeds my hummers ~ wonderful!"

It's the most attractive, with a glass cylinder and a copper finish on the metal cap and the plastic base surround, with metal flowers surrounding the ports that are protected by what the company identifies as bee guards. We haven't hit the time of year when bees are a problem around our hummingbird feeders, so I can't attest to their effectiveness.The glass cylinder is quite narrow, so it will be difficult to clean without a bottle brush. I also suggest getting a small brush to clean the ports, as they are deep enough that you really want to make sure that they get clean. The base comes apart, so it's easy to clean, but the metal flowers will slow you down a little. It's worth it, though, since they add to the attractiveness of the feeder. I didn't have any trouble with leaking, which was reported in some other reviews.The hummingbirds seem to like this feeder the best as well. Of the three feeders (all cylinder-style), they have been most attracted to this feeder. They do seem to have some problem perching and eating at the same time. It's possible that the bee guards are impeding their ability to get to the juice while sitting on the perches, as they usually hover while feeding.As with the 30-ounce feeder, this feeder came with a packet of nectar concentrate. I recommend tossing it in the garbage, and make a fresh batch of nectar by using four parts boiled water to one part sugar. The packet contains red dye, which the company states is harmless to the birds, but it's not necessary to attract them, so why take the chance?This is a very attractive feeder and would make a great gift. While they are not nearly as attractive, I still prefer the dish-style feeders, like the Aspects Hummzinger feeders that are available here, and the similar Wild Birds Unlimited-branded feeders, but this is pretty good as well."

        "text": "The Perky Pet 210PB Glass Hummingbird works.  The unit has a sufficinetly large opening, so it can be filled relatively easily.If you need a larger feeder like this, it may be a good choice.  However, be mindful of the fact that the sugar water must be changed every five (5) days or so.  Accordingly, you may find that sixteen (16) ounces of fluid is more than you need and you may end up pouring most of it out at the end of the week.  An eight (8) ounce unit may be a better choice.This model lacks an included hook for hanging.The bottle of this model is not open at each end, it is more difficult to clean than a model with a larger opening at the top.  Perky Pet makes at least one other model which opens on both ends allowing you to clean and fill the glass jar though the larger end. That means that you can use a soapy paper towel (rinse well afterwards with hot water to remove all traces of soap), to clean the bottle rather than having to purchase and use a narrow bottle washer brush.I have four different models, but far prefer the Perky Pet Perky-Pet 130TF 8-Ounce Glass Top Fill Hummingbird Feeder which has not of the above shortcomings and is a easy to fill and clean. It comes with a small \"S-Hook\" for hanging, too."

I've had cheap models in the past that had plastic bottles, but this model's bottle is made of sturdy feeling glass. The body of the feeder is plastic.I prefer glass bottles since they're easier to keep clean and don't get discolored by sunlight so you can tell when your feeding solution is getting cloudy and you can change it.I've not had an issue with ants, but there's a small 'moat' around the top to help keep them from stealing and the 'bee guard' helps keep bees from flooding the area around the feeder. This is especially important for my kids since they are bothered by bees being too close.The perch at the bottom of the feeder is removable, but I like to let the hummingbirds rest while they feed since it takes a lot of energy to hover in place."

Neither have those hummingbirds.I love the fact that this has attractive ant and bee guards and best of all, a place for the birds to perch.  It's like a bird bar, a welcoming watering hole for hummingbirds.As others on the U.S. boards have noted, you will need to take a small bottle brush to clean this and it is recommended that you clean it once a week.  I also like the fact that it came with a bag of nectar.  However, the only thing that bothered me was that the nectar was red.  Food dye is not good for hummingbirds.  When I make hummingbird food, I boil up sugar in water (usually 1:1 ratio).  However, the birds are enjoying it and that is what matters."

I was a little worried when ordering it due to the &#34;pinched&#34; waist - I thought it might be difficult to clean it - but it's larger than I expected, and my bottle brush fits through the &#34;waist&#34; easily.  LOVE the ant moat at the top - just fill with water and the little buggers find it pretty hard to get to the juice.  Great idea, as the ants can really be a problem here certain times of the year.It holds 16 ounces of nectar, which is plenty for around here.  We don't get hordes of hummers so if the nectar sits in there too long without being emptied, it gets fouled.The only drawback I can see is that the base on the bottom says &#34;tighten&#34; with arrows showing the direction, but it seems to just press-fit, with no threads to actually secure it?  We'll see how long that lasts before it can't hold the weight of the nectar.Overall it's working fine and it was nice that it also included some free nectar mix as a starter."

At last count we now have fifteen feeders up and ready to go scattered across our place.Now we have several different feeders made by several different companies but the majority of the feeders we use are those from Perky-Pet. Overall we have been delighted with these products. This happens to be the fourth of this particular model we have going at this time.Now this is an odd feeder. Of the four in use, three are just fine and he have had not problem with them what so ever. The fourth though...an older one, does indeed have a slow leak which for the life of me I cannot fix. I note from some of the other reviews that this seems to be a problem with this particular model from time to time.I do like the perches provided and the birds do too. It is easy to fill and easy to clean which is a big deal for us because we have so many and the weekly cleaning we give them is a major undertaking as is the almost daily filling when the height of the season is going.I cannot give these feeders the normal five stars I give products from this company simply because of the leaky situation. I am not sure if this is a quality control issue because the design (a common one) is sound and I have seldom encountered it before. I am more than satisfied with the units that work but of course less than satisfied with the units that no not.I suppose it is a matter of a bit of luck with this particular feeder...you either get a good one or a defective one.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"

Such as:  I could never get the bottom not to leak after filling the clear reservoir.  I tried it several times, nope its just going to drip.  And if the wind blows the water leaks out of the yellow feeder holes. While it looks like it will hold a lot, most of the sugar water goes into the red reservoir at the bottom when you turn it over after filling so the clear portion is about half full.  We actively have hummingbirds around and feeding,  I understand it takes awhile for them to start using a new device but the whole time it was out I only saw one hummingbird approach the feeder.The ant block reservoir.  In the meantime since it was hot the water that is suppose to keep out the ants evaporated and I ended up with ants actively feeding and getting into the feeder.  Then the birds will not drink.  While the water block is a great idea I really do not want to have to fill this constantly.  A good idea but not practical."

The birds must know quality better than most.  This one is glass and frankly, I am a glass snob with vigor.  Glass cleans better and lasts longer while apparently not leaving any residue from cleaning.Let's start at the moat top.  Instead of having to arrange a separate contraption such as I have previously and will do again this year, this feeder has an area in the top that permits visitors from below to stop by and drown.  I've always wondered if the dead creatures would be eaten by the hummers, but I have no evidence of that taking place.  But I always look.  The red top unscrews to permit full cleaning of the glass container.  I used a metal rod for holding plants to stakes to configure a tie down for the top's hanger.  It works well for me and I can control the size.The pinch waist permits more steady control of the feeder when holding or going from one location to another, but the real sensible addition to this feeder is the hummers' goodies (food) goes into the bottom instead of the top.  Picture turning the feeder upside down with the top engaged onto the glass feeder and pouring the food into the feeder while it is sitting on the sink.  When you have filled the feeder to the level you want, screw the bottom of the unit while still upside down and carry it to the feeder.  At that point turn the unit over and place it on the Shepard's hook or whatever you use to hold the feeder.  The incidence of spillage will reduce immediately.  (As was said by someone who could spill a steel rod.)After screwing the roosts onto the main unit and assuring their proper place in front of the little feeder holes the rest is as simple.  The bottom consists of two pieces which helps with keeping the entire unit clean and the hummers appreciate it.Right now, this unit has jumped from last to first in one week's use.  Another Perky-Pet occupies that #1 position and in a few days it will be joined by another family member.  Those little critters provide so much joy to us and some of our neighbors."

They absolutely adore it.We've been feeding hummingbirds at this house for 18 years now and we have tried pretty much everything over those years. If you've seen a style of hummingbird feeder, we've probably played with it. Right now we have probably twelve different old hummingbird feeders in a bin by the shed that I keep for who knows what reason. Out of all the styles, this is the one we're using now and we (and they) love it.It's quite easy to fill. The wide mouth means the liquid goes in easily. When they drink it doesn't create a large &#34;air bubble&#34; that temporarily scares them off. We have this on a double shepherd's crook in our back yard so it's not &#34;super stable&#34; by any stretch - and it doesn't leak at all. The ant water trap at the top works just the way it should and we just refill that each morning when we put it out.I'm surprised by people who complain that they have to fill the water each day - aren't you refilling your feeder each day? Or bringing it in at night? If we don't bring ours in, raccoons climb right up and drink from it :). And we like to give our hummingbirds fresh nectar each day - sugar-water in the sun is not an eternally fresh item.I'm not sure what to say to those who have a leaky unit. We haven't had any leaking at all and, as mentioned, it's hanging in a breezy location. Maybe it's something about how tightly we screw it. Part of what keeps a feeder from leaking is the vacuum that forms.In any case, our hummingbirds adore it, we love it, and this is our new favorite for the back yard.I was offered a free sample for review."

The weird thing is that the glass container portion holds maybe 10-12 ounces. The feeder will probably hold 16 ounces, because when you put the base on and flip it over, the fluid drains into the base for feeding. With some leftover in the feeder.

We saw this feeder and thought that we would give it a try.  Here is what we liked:1.  This feeder is VERY easy to clean and to fill!!  Some feeders are so small that it is difficult to get a brush up into them to keep them clean.  This is very important since a sugar solution in sunlight and heat spoils quickly and can make the birds sick.2.  The color definitely attracts them.  There is NO need to use colored solution and it is actually better not to since the dye is not good for the birds.  The bright color of the feeder itself is enough to attract hummingbirds.3.  If you have problems with bees or ants, this feeder us setup to help you keep them at bay.  The clever trap for ants at the top and the bee guards do a very nice job!!4.  This feeder holds just enough food to be able to supply a large number of birds before you would need to clean it out anyway.  We found that if we fill it about 2/3 full, it was enough for the birds to go through most of it before it was time to clean it out.  Depending upon the amount of sun and heat, it takes 3 to 6 days for the liquid to start to cloud up and to require replacement.  ALWAYS clean your feeder when you change food!!Things that we did not like as much:1.  The perch is sort of a pain to keep aligned.  It is really necessary, probably not, but the birds will take advantage of it if it is there.All in all, this is very well made product that works as it should.  One quick note, any feeder will leak if it is in high winds!!!  When the winds were less than 12 mph we did not find any issue with leakage."

The main problems with hummingbird feeders is they can leak, they fill up with ants and the wasps take over and keep the birds away. This feeder after being up for a week does not leak. They have addressed the other issues, but it will be awhile in Wisconsin before these other issues are tested. The area where the bird gets the juice has a raised end point to keep the wasps from getting the juice. The top of the feeder has a reservoir which can be filled with water to keep the ants from crossing over to the feeder from the hanger. I have not yet been able to test these, but they do seem like good ideas.One problem that I can foresee is that the water will evaporate quickly and will require attention. The container for the provided nectar fills the feeder about half way. Generally we just use sugar and water which is boiled to purify. This takes time and a  premix would be nice, though the one that comes with the unit does have food coloring in it which I see as unnecessary. The perches on the feeder are very flimsy but then...hummingbirds don't weigh much.  Overall you likely cannot go wrong with this feeder. If the pest &#34;fixes&#34; don't work, you have a good feeder which will be just like all other feeders anyway."

The chairs, themselves, come in two pieces and have four bolts to put in which is very easy if you have a helper but not impossible for one person to do.  The fire pit itself came completely assembled.  However, to get it through the house to the back yard I did have to take the top off.  That was easy since it had only four screws holding that on.Everything is well made and the chairs are very comfortable.  The seat bottom is made in a way so that it is not supposed to sag over time.  The reason for the 4 stars is the color of the upholstery.  It tends to be on the yellowish side of brown and everything in my yard leans toward reddish brown. The product picture even has a slight reddish tone to it.  Wish there was a choice of upholstery colors.  But I must say I am very pleased with the quality.This set will be outside 24/7 in Southern Arizona so the cloth and the metal finish will really get a tough test.  I would like to download my pictures but did not see anyway to do it for this product."

        "text": "Hanover's Summer Night set is very, very nice. It is high quality and very well made. We absolutely love it. The set came very well packaged...BIG, but well packaged. Everything we received was in excellent condition and there was no damage to any of the furniture. I was definitely worried about putting this set together, but it went together incredibly smoothly and I will even say easily. I have to admit, I did not put it together myself, I am not able to physically right now, but my daughter and two of her friends (all three 19 years old) had the whole set together and everything up and running in about an hour, maybe a little longer. I watched them put the chairs together and they were really just two pieces and the bolts. Once the figured out the first chair, the next 3 were easy. Same for the table/fire pit, once they got the gist of the instructions it went together pretty easy. I still can't believe it. I was pretty proud of them.I thought it would be in parts in my yard for a week at least. The only thing one of them did say, is it would have been nice to have some written instructions rather than just the drawn kind, but they did figure those out, it just took a little longer.Now that it's together, we just love it. We love the look of the set and everything is just so well made. The chairs rock very nicely, but do not tip back too far and the cushions are sturdy, thick and really just awesome to sit on. I've never had really well made patio cushions before, so I am appreciating the ones with this set. One little thing I will mention that isn't a big deal, but more of a personal preference is that I wish the the backs on the chairs were just a little higher. That is a personal thing though and I am the only one who mentioned it in using the set, maybe because I am taller, I just prefer my chair backs a little higher.It's been pretty cool in the evenings so we have been getting quite a bit of use out of the fire pit and table. It is just perfect for a cool evening. Easy to set up and use, we have enjoyed it many nights already.I went back and forth between a 4 and 5 review for this set. Recently the set here on Amazon was priced at $1,299 and at the price it is definitely a 5 star patio set. Now though, it is priced at $1,799 and even though it is a very nice quality set, I can't quite give it 5 stars, the price now being the reason for the 4 star review today 6/17/14. The patio set itself is very nice though, I wouldn't hesitate in recommending to anyone, just maybe shop around a little bit first."

        "text": "There are a few aspects of this well-made set that should get some attention in a review, especially for a high-ticket item like this one.ARRIVAL AND ASSEMBLY - at least as I received it, it comes in three big boxes on a pallet. As other reviews noted, it will take about about an hour to break everything down, take all the packing paper off, get it all out of the boxes THEN you can start to actually construct it.Good news - while the paper is all taped around the chair's metal frames, it is easily ripped masking tape. So it wasn't difficult to get the packing paper off, just time consuming. And that's a good thing! The set should arrive without any dings or damage.The fire pit comes assembled. It is a TWO person job to move it, and it it's in top box. So expect to need two people to do all this.The chairs are easy to assemble with two people AND a socket wrench set. I tried to use the included wrench, but that would have taken forever! But using a socket wrench took maybe two minutes a chair - very easy. Again - two person job. I wouldn't even try to do it myself. The chairs are not light, and to line up and then screw in the bolts is not worth the hassle of doing it yourself. And to repeat - use a socket wrench.You are going to be left with an enormous amount of packing material - again, not a bad thing. Just make some space before it all arrives so you don't huge cardboard boxes getting in your way after the fact.QUALITY - this is really the most important thing anyway, and on this score, this set seems worth the money and very well-made.The chairs are metal with welded slats to enable the rocking. While the metal is light, it's still heavy-duty enough to hold up against the sun and the rain (I hope, anyway). The rocking motion is nice and i think a neat switch from a standard unmoving chair.The cushions are thick fabric - and you're going to pay at least $50 for a similar cushion anywhere I've seen. Maybe more, since this is a two cushion set. Again, the fabric seems good quality and should hold up.If you paid $225 for the chair/cushion, you'd be looking at $900 for the set and I don't think that's unreasonable. Expensive, but not unreasonable or unexpected. The cushions would probably be included.The fire pit is solid, and while I don't love the design on the sides, it's okay and you won't notice it that much. The pit itself is not that high and a few chairs around the edge will fill it in quite nicely. It certainly would cost $400 by itself - probably more. And with the chairs, that puts this at a fair price of $1300, which is what it's currently listed at.As for the fire pit performance, I haven't used it yet, but I'll update that part of it later. I wanted to do all this now while it was fresh in my head! It's not like you'll be cooking on the flame, anyway. It's mostly for the ambience.SIZE - I have a 20x11 deck, and that is the minimum amount of space you need - assuming you already have other deck furniture. I already had a table, a few chairs and a chaisse lounge. Obviously, these chairs replaced a few others - but even then, the space got filled quick. Ideally, you'd have a 20x16 space, and I think that would be perfect.The chairs rock, so you can't push them up against a fence or railing - not a negative, just be aware. They take up space but they are big and comfortable. They are deep cushioned, so you'll end up sitting back from the table a little bit.The fire pit measures 38x38, but again - it's more than that. You need space for the chairs to have space, and it's going to take up a lot, quick. So if you ALREADY have a table/umbrella like most decks do, be aware of all that.None of this is a bad thing, and most buyers probably have a lot more space than me and it won't even be an issue.To sum up - good quality that feels high-end and well-made. They're charging high-end price and they are delivering a product that seems to deserve it. The cushions and the rocking chair are fun. The fire pit ledge gives a good space to put drinks, but I don't think I'd try to use it as an eating surface.It doesn't come with a cover, and I would get one. I don't like the idea of rainwater getting underneath the rocks...although since it doesn't have a base, the water won't collect in anything. Still, I would get a cover.At $1300, it's pricey, but I think you'll get what you're paying for - I like these chairs, and the pit is a neat addition to the deck ambiance. I will update this review as I see the quality prove itself over the sun and rain of the summer months."

Everything arrived in perfect condition.  Prepare yourself for three really large and heavy boxes.  There are two chairs per box and the table is separate.  As far as assembly, it took about 45 minutes for the first chair and once we had that finished and knew how to do it, it took about 45 minutes total to do the other three.  The table comes in just two parts so that was easy.  It's really just a visually stunning set and the comfort level exceeded my expectations.  We've used it almost ever night so far and expect it to last for years and years.  I am so very pleased with this set and would highly recommend it to anyone."

        "text": "I'm a little stumped on how to rate this set.  From a construction standpoint both the chairs and the fire pit are top notch, but while I love the chairs I honestly don't care for the \"look\" of the fire pit.  It is just too Gothic/medieval looking for my tastes.Chairs:* The chairs are sturdy and well-constructed (will probably last for decades).  Everything seems to be made of the highest quality materials.*  The frames are made of heavy-gauge aluminum-alloy, and finished in an attractive shade of oiled-rubbed bronze.  There are subtle hints of gold along the edges of the metal bars and the circular details on the sides of the chair.*  The welded joints are flat and smooth with no rough seams to snag your clothing or prick your fingers.*  The chairs are described as rockers, but the motion is very subtle.  The \"rocking\" is a smooth back and forth motion and with very little of an up and down element, more like a glider and less like the see-saw motion of a traditional rocking chair.* The cushions are plump and the stuffing is soft.  The fabric is thick enough to withstand years of exposure to the elements.  But I also found the think fabric a little stiff and coarse (more on the burlap end than the polished cotton end).  The color of the fabric is an earthy kind of yellowish brown.  It is a little dull and boring at first glance, but I added some bright floral throw pillows to brighten it up.  The bottom cushions have extra strong Velcro straps to secure them to the chair, but the back cushion is not attached to the chair.  Having the back cushion loose lets you adjust the plump cushion for the most comfortable position.  The loose, back cushion also allows a tall person to remove it completely.  I have some tall (6'+) people in the family, and they have mentioned that the fat pillows force them to sit too far forward in the chair.  Removing the back cushion makes them feel less like they are perched on the edge of the seat.  The metal back of the chair is also nicely curved so sitting without the back cushion is completely comfortable.Fire Pit:I'm sorry but I just don't like the way the fire pit looks.  It is big and bulky and looks like something you would find in a medieval castle, or at Stonehenge, or at Machu Picchu.  Did I mention that it was Big?  And Huge?  And Heavy?  This is not something that you can easily put away during the summer.  I also don't care for the molded decorations on the sides of the pit.  The fiberglass is painted black and gold to match the chairs, but the dark colors just make the pit look like a massive boulder.  My first impression when I unboxed the pit was that someone had sent me King Arthur's Stone.But on a positive note the fire pit is easy to operate.  Hooking up the propane is a snap, and the lava rocks are so much nicer than the popping wood of my old fire pit.  It is also great that you can adjust the flame to suite the mood or the outside temperature.  But I do wish the pit came with a cover to conceal and protect the element/fire ring when not in use.  The fire pit is too big to store in the shed during the summer so I'm afraid the pit will have to weather the heat, humidity and rain of summer.  I expect bugs and mildew will invade the dark recesses of the pit in no time flat.So how many stars?  I'll give it 4.  I love the chairs and most of my objections to the fire pit are just a matter of personal taste."

        "text": "This Rumford Gardener Tuff-Guard Expanding Hose is the second hose of this genre I tested.  The first one was the lime green Rumford Gardener Expanding Hose.  It broke at multiple places in three months on very light use.  This second expanding hose fared even worse; it exploded with a loud pop on my driveway on the second use.Knowing the vulnerability of this kind of hoses, I had treated this hose with kid-gloves.  I turned on the water valve from  to  and let the hose expand over a period of one minute before I turned on the valve fully.  I used the hose only on smooth cement surface.  I drained the hose after use and stored it in a covered bucket in my covered patio.  The water pressure of my house is consistently around 75 psi, well within the norm of residential water supply.  My advice to Amazon shoppers is to stick to heavy-duty rubber hoses.  They are heavy and clunky but they don't explode in your faces like these expandable hoses.P.S. There is no warranty or any contact info of the manufacturer in the box. The only recourse a buyer has in case of problem with this hose is to return to Amazon within one month. Outside of that, he/she is hosed."

        "text": "I have some really nice, heavy-duty hoses for washing the car, etc. Sometimes, though, it'd be nice to have a lighter hose for watering plants or something -- a hose that doesn't require a special storage rack & the effort of winding it back up when I'm done using it.For a while, I used one of those self-coiling plastic hoses (like the hose version of a slinky) but it always got coiled around itself and ended up being less convenient than just a normal hose, really.THIS hose, however, is awesome. It combines the durability of a heavy-duty hose with convenience and compactness.+ outer webbing provides superior protection from abrasion, and the elements+ rubber inner hose material is lightweight, but expands to full size+ compact and flexible when not in use+ built-in spigot means I don't even need a spray handle attachment with this hoseThe only 'downside' is -- this hose gives me a little less water output than a normal garden hose. It's plenty for watering the plants, but might be less than ideal for washing off the pool deck or rinsing off your car. Other than that, I think it's awesome. Highly recommended."

        "text": "I love the idea and have used an expanding hose before, even directly compared this one to a new Pocket Hose Ultra.  This one had too many drawbacks for me.  After I got this hose untangled which took a while (it doesn't compress as small as the Pocket Hose) I connected it eagerly.  I was impressed by the brass fittings and sturdy appearance of the hose, but it's maybe too much of a good thing.  First off it wouldn't expand smoothly.  The crinkled fabric outer skin bunched up in various areas restricting the water flow to other parts.  I couldn't manually smooth out the troubled areas, but figured since I didn't really need all 50' on my deck, that wasn't a deal breaker.In order to get the hose to expand to semi-full size, its on/off 'switch' must be in the off position so the water pressure builds up and forces the expansion.  When expanded in that manner, the hose is quite hard and was not easy for me to maneuver.  It is lighter weight than a rubber hose, but not very flexible. Once to the edge of my deck, I opened the pressure switch all the way and got the equivalent of the jet setting on a nozzle attachment.  The water stream projected a long way, but wouldn't be suitable for watering plants.  It had the force of my small pressure washer.  Still, I thought that with a nozzle I might be able to regulate the water flow to my liking.  I never did get around to adding a nozzle though because with the pressure switch open the hose started to contract back to a smaller size and I had to work to keep it from pulling me back to the hookup.  I had to use more and more strength to keep it where I wanted it.  It was not a pleasant experience.I'd had enough with only the one sample use and went to turn off the water and try the Pocket Hose for comparison.  I again turned off the pressure switch on the hose as I returned to the spigot, but when I turned it back on to drain the water after turning the water off at the spigot, the hose went crazy like a striking snake and danced out of my hand spraying me all over.  Too bad someone wasn't taking a video, it would win America's Funniest.The Pocket Hose is a worm compared to this python.  Of course it's only 1/2\" where this is 3/4\", but it's far better behaved and that's the hose I'll be using until the plastic fittings give out.  Still I gave this hose two stars even as I sit here dripping wet because for some folks, particularly stronger people than I, the pressure and power of this hose will be a benefit and the fittings may last longer than the wimpy ones on the Pocket Hose."

Basically a tube enclosed in a fabric sleeve, this expands when the water is on and collapses when not in use making it very easy to store/tuck in a small hose basket.  I also like the metal fittings which hopefully will hold up much better than the plastic fittings that tend to come with a lot of hoses these days.  No issues connecting to outside faucets or connecting various attachments.However, if you need something with a lot of power you'll need a wider hose circumference than this.  My husband used it to clean off the deck and it didn't have as much pressure as our regular hose.  It did work a better when he took off the spray attachment - enough so that he didn't bother to drag out the regular hose."

The brass fittings are solidly made - not those ultra-thin fittings that break the first time.  It helps that it comes in my wife's favorite color purple.  We have a large yard and our sprinklers do not cover everything perfectly.  To reach the farthest corners of our yard we need 150 feet of hose.  To cover that with this hose we'd need  6 hoses (3 for the front and 3 for the back).  That's rather expensive.  But 150 feet of regular hose is soooo heavy.  What we do is use 100 feet of regular hose and then put one of these expanding hoses on the end and that works as most of the weight you are lugging around is the final 50 feet.  because of the solid brass fittings we readily change sprayers as needed."

        "text": "Update 6/13/2014: After initially saying he didn't really like this hose and would probably rarely, if ever, use it, my husband has totally changed his mind from when we first tried this hose.  I asked him what he thinks now, and he said, \"Oh, my god, I love it!  You just have to get used to how you have to use it.  We should have gotten one of these years ago.\"  And despite our initial impressions, this is now his go-to hose when he's using a sprinkler.  He's also really happy that you can adjust the spray to high pressure without needing an attachment (a feature he didn't think he needed at first but now regularly uses).Here's my original review:This hose will NOT replace all hose needs.  If you need a very lightweight hose for, say, watering planters near the faucet, this will work.  But that's about all it's good for.Pros:*It's shockingly light.*It does retract (sort of).Cons:*You will not get anywhere near a 50-foot reach with this thing.  30 is more like it.*The flow is VERY low.*It's impractical to use with any attachment (sprinkler, for example) because the end of the hose (and the attachment) whips around when you turn off the water.*Speaking of whipping around, make sure there are no kids, pets, plants, or anything breakable in the way of this hose or near the end when you turn off the faucet.  The hose is gonna whip 'em.*The hose doesn't seem very sturdy or durable.However, if you really want and/or need a lightweight hose, as long as you know what you are in for with this type of product, this is probably among the better ones.  But for our yard, it was really little more than a novelty.  I'll stick with lugging myGilmouraround."

The large inner diameter of 3/4&#34; allows for great water flow when using the hose for washing cars, but it is not satisfactory for sprinklers, power washers, or other things that have different and varying pressures.Our primary need for garden hoses is to water lawn and garden, so this won't be of too much help.  I guess the novelty of having it curl back up into minimal space is clever and useful for many, but in our case it just looks sloppy laying on the porch or deck.  We keep our hoses in reel up storage containers and it leaves a clean, neat area.It was fun to watch the hose stretch out and return to the empty position, that's not enough to warrant the expense."

After using it for three times it blew apart at the seams, and his water pressure is not all that great!  To the garbage it went!This product is, other than expanding, is a different product and superior in all ways.  The brass fittings are top quality, heavy duty, and well made.  The hose itself is much heavier duty, has the feel of quality!I too, like another reviewer, have one of those hose reels that you wind the hose on.  You position the reel in the direction that you want to water and pull out the hose, it has a connection at the faucet with a short hose to the reel with another connection and finally a connection for the garden hose-----mine always is dripping from one of the fittings.  The Gardener Tuff-Gard eliminates all of those connections and uses so much less space, without the ugly reel living by the faucet.We have our Tuff-Guard on a faucet near the patio where my wife has potted plants up the gazoo!  This is so much easier to use, no more pulling hose from the reel, dragging it around the outside chairs and plant stands and occasionally knocking something over.....and the best thing, when you're done, turn off the water, release the water pressure in the hose and kabam!----the whole thing disappears into one small neat heap!!!  By the way, the hose real is gone and so is the impossible hose that was wrapped around it."

For the cons - you need to follow the directions for it to work properly, the water pressure is disappointing and it is rather fragile when compared to a 'normal' hose. I've found it's better for watering plants and washing the car rather than for running a sprinkler or connecting to the pressure washer. Overall, I can see the promise in the idea but most of our water usage outside requires a bit more ooomph, so I see us sticking with a more traditional hose for now."

Unfortunately, we've had a very mild sinter, so the winter test part will have to wait until next December.It is very light weight, packs up into small ball of hose which they said it will. It does grow/expand with the water pressure on and does not kink. This should do the job we need it for but will have to buy another hose since we need 100 feet to get into all areas we need to water and hose off in cleaning.I'd buy this...well, I guess I will buy this again to get the footage needed!"

Most of them work great for a brief time-- you feel happy because they are indeed lighter and easier to handle than typical hoses that are unwieldy, heavy, and a pain to store. This is the kind of thing you can just unscrew and toss into the shed... well, kind of. If your shed doesn't get too hot.The thing is, it seems that it's going to burst eventually even if you treat it right, but you're supposed to really handle it with kid gloves: Don't leave it out in the sun or cold. You have to shake it dry in between uses and store it indoors. It's not safe for drinking water.If you're absolutely determined to try this type of hose, then Rumford seems to be the best of them at the moment (maybe due to the better brass fitting), but that's not saying much. A product this likely to burst under normal use shouldn't be on the market yet."

Upgrading to 5 stars.Cutting to the chase, this is a worthy replacement for those hoses that coil like an old-fashioned telephone cord.On the other hand, it IS a great party trick. If and until this type of hose becomes common, amaze your neighbors and scare children as this thing expands like some deadly snake awakening from slumber and then retracts in jerky, life-like spasms.Pros:-REALLY light and compact. almost looks like a limp ribbon hanging under the faucet. You could stuff it in a little flower pot. There is no tedious winding or tangling: that is huge for me.-Solid metal ends. Apparently they are brass; They are not flimsy stamped metal. Also, the end has a built-in ball valve; you almost do not need to add a nozzle because small adjustments of the lever let the stream evolve from shower to jet.-Handles our 70 lb. water pressure just fine, although I find the stream more like what comes out of a half inch hose than a 5/8th.-So far does not seem to tangle or kink.Cons:-You can't just turn on the water and use it. You must allow it to fill slowly. It is fun to watch but takes well a minute.-According to instructions, you mustn't store it in direct sunlight. How long before this thing deteriorates?-You must also let it drain. Don't keep it under pressure; but this happens quicker than \"inflating\".-If this thing leaks or you damage the female end, there is no repairing it like a conventional hose, so take care.I Will update if there are durability issues, but so far, this is my new hose."

If any problems develop, I would report here on an updatedreview, but as I said, So far it's wonderful and I love it's strong but light weight build and I think I have a winner here"

You have to seal the hose off and fill it with water first. It takes a while and is disconcerting.Also, it's spring in Georgia, and the pine pollen is abundant. With the fabric coating on this hose, it creates a mess and attracts the pollen, so it's already filthy.It doesn't feel sturdy. Maybe it's sturdier than it feels, but I'm not hopeful it'll last a long time.As an avid gardener, I should know better. Truly, a good, heavy-duty rubber hose is the only way to go.Maybe if you live in a condo and have a small balcony and rarely need a hose, something like this would work."

        "text": "My wife loves gardening and we don't have a sprinkler system, so we have to use hoses all the time, which means unwinding, rewinding, etcetera.  The Rumfort Gardener Tuff-Guard Expanding Hose is a real blessing, because it's lighter, more compact, more attractive, and makes the chore so much easier.  Simply attach the female coupling to the water source, turn the on-off valve to off, turn the water at the source by slowly increasing the pressure, and the hose will automatically expand to approximately 50 feet.  The solid brass valve can be adjusted to get a powerful spray, but is designed to attach a sprinkler too.  Simply follow the basic instructions, attach the sprinkler while the valve is off, face the sprinkler away from you, place it where needed, and turn the valve on.  However, it is not recommended that you use a high pressure nozzle or pressure washer, so this may be an issue for some people - hence the 4-stars.  When finished watering, allow the water in the hose to flow out by leaving the valve on, and the hose will shrink to a smaller size.Warnings found in the instructions are, that it is not intended for drinking water; do not stretch or expand when empty; do not run hot water through it; do not leave hose under pressure with water on if not in use; and keep hose indoors and dry during winter."

They have had one for 3 months and I have had it for 1.  I like that it collapses down into a small pile that can be hidden easily and out of view.  It is nice and light in weight.I really enjoy that the hose doesn't kink or get all tangled but it is much different than your typical hose.  It takes a little getting used to.  I use this hose for daily watering of potted plants, vegetation, and cleaning things up.  It says up to 250 psi and includes a special valve to control water pressure at the faucet. I have not used it with(nor plan on using it with) my power washer or nozzle since it seems a bit more delicate than your typical hose.  The couplings are brass and worked well with my faucet. The directions want you to slowly allow water pressure into the hose...but this only take a couple of extra seconds, no biggie.  I like this hose!"

This thing is easy to hook up - probably easier than most hoses because it is so light-weight.  The valve on the end is very handy.  Once the water is on, the hose pressurizes, and it is easy to pull it out to expand to the length needed, up to the full length.When I'm finished using it, I turn off the water, keep the spray open to let the water out of the hose, and it practically springs back to a minimal length, and is super-easy to put away!  Awesome!!!My only - minimal - complaint is that when I have it pulled out to my garden, there is always some tension on it, always some pull, pulling it back towards the hose bib.  So I'm always pulling on it to keep it where I want.  But for how easy it is to put away, I'm willing to deal with that."

Oh, to have a hose on hand!!!!But, as anyone knows who owns a hose, they are bulky, heavy and if you are transporting them in your vehicle, they take up a VAST amount of room! So, it was with great interest that I ordered THIS expandable hose, having seen them advertised on TV for years and on the snarkier side, seeing them lying in dirty coils in the trash cans in our alleys.When I received the box, I was immediately impressed with the uber-light weight of \"fifty feet of hose\" and the teeny-tiny box it came packaged inside of. I was also impressed with the very heavy duty brass couplings, since the tossed away hoses I've seen ALL had cheap plastic couplings.I read the instructions, had the gate valve OFF, slowly allowed the water to expand the hose, and then I waited an additional 10 minutes for the hose to reach maximum length. However, I did have to manually \"extend\" the hose by starting at the faucet and stretching out the wrinkles from the covering, so that it was as close to 50 feet as advertised.How does it work? GREAT, if you have NO HOSE! Also, GREAT if you don't need a standard hose's far more rapid and pressurized volume of water. You will NOT be able to use the Jet setting on your nozzle to power wash your deck or sidewalk. You will NOT be able to fill a 5 gallon bucket very fast. But, for watering some hanging baskets or shrubs or allowing for more time to fill up a pond or bucket, this hose sure beats having NO HOSE!One note of caution: with the wrinkles that are ALWAYS present on the surface of this hose, it catches/snags on the slightest of surfaces in your garden, which may exacerbate the demise of it's lifespan. A normal smooth-surface garden hose glides over flagstone, mulch and gravel; the textured surface of this hose snags on everything! So, when I was using it, I literally had to start at the nozzle and \"walk the hose\" over the entire surface of the job site so I could avoid snagging it and ripping it. And when I drained and coiled it up, I had to end up washing the entire hose off because it picked up all the sand we laid on the patio, making for one messy hose.This may read as a negative review but it's NOT! I'd \"give a kidney\" to have a hose in a pinch at a job site and am exceedingly pleased that I can drain and coil this hose up into a shoe-box sized container, to have \"In Case of Emergency\". But, I'd never-ever recommend this hose or ANY expandable hose to take the place of a regular Swan/Gilmore solid walled hose; they are literally two different animals. But, for very light use and infrequent use, this hose rocks!"

But you'll be amazed that a 50 ft hose fits in the tiny box it comes in.the cutoff valve for where you hook up to the spay nozzle is a great idea, so you can change attachments without going back to turn off the spigot.Feels strong. Black allows it to soak up heat so you have a bit of hot water at first, nice for washing down garden tools or topping off a swimming pool.I let the water out and left outside during a freeze night and it was fine. Would not recommend keeping it connected to fixtures though.Time will tell how durable it is.

I've seen the ads for hoses like this one, that collapse down and you don't have to fight with huge tubes of whatever hoses are made of, but I needed a new hose, and I decided to chance it.  I'm glad I did.First off:  The hose seems to be plenty tough enough to handle everything that I've thrown at it so far, hauling it around over pavement, uneven ground, and through weeds.  I gave it a month to be sure, but no leaks so far.The hose is also very light.  I am not a strong person.  Absolutely not upper body strength.  But I have no trouble at all moving this hose around from place to place in my garden.  The way that it collapses when not in use is very convenient.  It's nice not to be tripping over acres of hose scattered all over the patio like I was.All in all, a good purchase, and I'm glad I took the chance on it."

This hose has brass fittings instead of plastic ones and it's remarkably lightweight. It has a blade valve on one end so you can control water flow at the business end. It doesn't take but a few seconds for the hose to fill out and stretch to the full length. When the water is turned off, it takes a few seconds as it draws up to about a third of the full size. The hose then can be gathered up to the size of a loaf of bread and it weighs about as much. Not bad for a 50 foot hose with brass fittings. It doesn't take much space to store it, so it would be ideal for campers, boats, etc. Anywhere a hose would be handy to have but space is limited. It has a good solid feel when it is full and there are no leaks."

As they say you can't teach an old dog new tricks nor can you expect someone to change how they have used garden hoses all their lives. You are supposed to follow a specific method for initially operating the hose. Another factor in rating it a 1 is there is no manufacturer contact information included with the hose. None on the box and none in the directions. I also tried to find the manufacturer on the internet and no luck there either.If the hose goes bad, you are simply out of luck. Another concern is that this hose is not to be used for drinking water. Makes me wonder what is leaching out from this hose into the water and worry also about pets or animals drinking water that came out of this hose. The better option is a 50' coiled hose which we have two of. I bought two very good quality coiled hoses and have been using them for 3 seasons now without any problems.

The Rumford came in a much bigger box as it doesn't coil up as small as the ASOTV version. But, that's a good thing because the Rumford is made of better higher quality materials. First off the hose rubber feels thicker and the outer fabric is much better. The fittings are brass and it also has an on off valve on it so if you didn't want to hook up one of those sprayer nozzles you don't have to.The ASOTV version doesn't tell you that you need to slowly turn on the faucet because the pressure will burst it. It also doesn't tell you how much pressure it is rated for whereas the Rumford is rated for 250psi. From my research, i do not think either version likes to stay out in the weather so I recommend that after use, you put it in a shed, garage or some kind go mini storage shed out of the sun as the UV may damage it and lessen the life of the hose.The hose itself is very thin and you won't get the same pressure as a normal garden hose because its just to thin. Its more for watering plants and the quick use especially in off seasons where your main hose is away for the winter. I've used this to wash the car real fast to get the salt off it from the roads since my regular hose was frozen. Its easy to quick connect, use and then disconnect and put in the garage out of the cold and harsh weather.One thing I immediately noticed is that it smells. I guess its the rubber or something but its stinky. Don't drink from it or let the kids do that either, not that you should anyway because of the bacteria...i watch Dr. Oz too much i think..lolFor now its convenient and there's no winding up the hose in one of those crank storage boxes which is the main reason for getting this hose. I seem to curse at the regular hose every time i use it because its difficult to unwind and then rewind because it gets bent and tangled up. This hose surely keeps that from happening.Can't say how long this version of the expanding hose will last but we shall see. I gave it 4 stars because its just not thick enough for all purposes I need."

I've bought a number of hoses in my life - and something always happens to the hose to make it worthless. The cheap hoses give you a lot of length for very low cost - but they kink within minutes of unwrapping them from their manufactured packaging. I've spent big money on the high-end hoses that don't kink - but they are so heavy and cumbersome. You have to roll them up - eventually you just leave them out and something happens to bend/crimp the metal end to make them unusable.There are drawbacks to any scenario - including this compact hose. You have to fill it completely (which is kinda fun the first time around) to build up the pressure to expand it before you can start to use it. This isn't the kinda hose you just let trickle while taking a sip at the other end - it's not a pressure washer per se, but you have to have the nozzle on the business end for it to work. When you're done using the hose, you have to let the water get out of it so it can retract to storage size.We live out in the country, so a pile of hose is an invitation for snakes, spiders and other unseemly creatures to huddle. I like that this is so light weight and portable, that I can quickly remove it and put it in storage when it's not in use and its long enough that I can use it just about anywhere in our yard.The fabric will pick up dirt, pollen, etc. - but there are trade offs for any gizmo you get. The pluses outweigh the negatives in my book."

Here are my thoughts.Good:-The fittings are beefy brass and feel solid and are smooth to operate.-The shutoff valve has what I believe to be a stainless steel ball, not just plastic.-The collars of the fittings travel down the hose a bit, to help ease the concern of damage to the connection points.-The hose is incredibly light.-The webbing feels durable.-It expands to 50 feet and shrinks down to about 20 feet.-Easy to store.-Nice strong stream.Not so good:-During use, you have to let the hose fill up with the shutoff valve turned off. Once the hose is filled and expanded, then you can open the valve and use the hose. Maybe my water pressure is not up to this hose's requirements, but the hose shrinks down to about 34 feet during use. It sprays out for a while until it shrinks down, then it turns into a full pressure stream. If I just turn the water on without giving it time to fill up and expand, the full pressure stream comes out and it slowly expands a little, but not to the full length.-While the hose is not fully expanded, it is stretchy. This concerns me as the fittings receive a lot of strain during this. I wish they had made the fittings travel even further up the hose with a long point of contact. I'd feel a lot more confident.-If I have a 50 foot hose, I expect it to be a 50 foot hose - not 50 foot for a few seconds and then 34 foot.It has promise, but maybe this style hose just isn't for me. Maybe my water pressure is not strong enough to maintain the full length during use. My expectation was for the hose to maintain the 50 foot length until I was done and ready to put it up. I'll let it fill up and expand, walk out to my tree to water it, and once I turn the water on, I have to start walking backward as the hose shrinks on me. Convenience lost!"

Not a huge deal since most of the time, you're not moving it, but it *is* heavy and despite the big wheels, it's not easy to pull around.Assembly was somewhat frustrating, though not technically difficult. The instructions were clear - very clear - but snapping together some of the pieces was very difficult. I specifically struggled with the wheels; the wheel trim, shown in the image here as yellow - mine were silver, were supposed to be removed before putting on the wheels. Then, you put the wheel trim back in after the wheels were on and snap/push it into place. It was very hard to do that. I also struggled with transport handle; I really had to struggle to get the piece lined up right to get the screws in. I essentially had to bend/shove it into place so I could get it attached.Total time to get this put together: less than 30 mins.The AC cord is plenty long, as is the cord for the trigger gun. The cord for the gun had to be un-looped several times; I can only hope this loosens up in time - it's pretty stiff.When I used this for the first time, there was a weird motor noise that kept happening when I was spraying. It was like the motor was struggling, or tripping - every few seconds. I reset the power and did not experience this problem again. However, there were three other occasions where the power was tripped and I had to reset it. I have no idea why, or if this is normal behavior for this particular unit.There are two wands that come with the unit:1) Vario Power Spray wand2) Dirtblaster (rotary spray wand)The unit is plenty powerful, so no issues there. I tried both wands and found that the Dirtblaster wand was easier to use. I power washed the siding on my house and some pavement. I also accidentally swiped this over my cedar fence and deck - DO NOT DO THAT - it will shred soft wood like that.However, the Dirtblaster wand is supposed to spray in a circular motion - and it did, for a while - but it didn't do that all the time. Sometimes it would spray in a circular motion, sometimes just a straight stream of water. It cleaned just fine either way, but I think something was off about that. In reading the instructions, it says that the Dirtblaster wand is NOT to be used for siding, so don't be like me - read the manual first!Overall, a great power washer!PROS: Very powerful and capable, front lip for holding wand cord, detergent tank, two wands for cleaning of most surfaces, easy to wind AC cord around back.CONS: Heavy. Wand cord is super stiff. Not easy to pull this unit around."

        "text": "I have a very minimal need for pressure washing, pretty much limited to doing the front stairs and sidewalk and maybe the back deck once a year or so. For that reason, I prefer the smaller, easier to handle electric type. I didn't have any complaints about myAR Blue Clean AR383 1,900 PSI 1.5 GPM 14 Amp Electric Pressure Washer with Hose Reel, but I was glad to give this Karcher with similar specs and profile a try.Really the only thing I didn't like was the amount of assembly required and the crappy instructions for putting it together. I don't know when it became fashionable for companies to give all their assembly and operation instructions with pictures only, but I'd wish they'd stop and just tell us what to do. Fortunately, assembling the pieces of this pressure washer was not that bad, as there are only a few ways things can go together in the first place. All in all assembly took only around thirty minutes and I didn't use nearly as many bad words as I've used with other products.Once it was together, this pressure washer was very easy to operate: plug it in, press the button, connect and turn on the hose and turn on the washer. You can use the adjustable sprayer for focused or low power washing, or you can use the rotating head for a powerful, clean \"sweeping\" action. Both heads worked great and having the adjustable flow was very useful when I used it to wash my car. Typical operation for cleaning the stairs and sidewalk was as expected: move back for a wider, slower spray, move in for a narrower, faster spray. Everything just worked. This one is slightly more powerful than my blue pressure washer, but just as easy to operate. A slightly longer cord and/or hose would have made it ideal, but I don't really have any complaints. This is a good product, but I'm deducting one star for the amount of assembly and the fussy, cartoonish instructions. Otherwise, this is quite a good pressure washer."

        "text": "I previously owned another Karcher before testing this one and there's a noticeable difference in several features. The quick connectors work very well for getting the unit set up fast and there is a range of wands for different applications (including a scrubbing kit which I'd not seen before). The unit looks more or less identical to the old one, containing a holster for the spray and a holder for coiling the cable.In terms of pressure, it's extremely powerful, second only to the much more expensive gasoline washers and better than the previous Karcher. To compare both machines, on a dirty driveway I would have to hold the wand of the old machine only an inch from the ground to create enough pressure to remove stains and ground-in dirt. On this model you can comfortably use a 4-5 inch spread to achieve the same effect which makes the job much, much faster. At a 1-inch distance the new machine will remove almost anything at all.It's a great machine in its simplicity and power and has reduced my six-monthly pressure washing tasks from 2 hours down to about 30 minutes. It feels like a solid, commercial unit and is definitely the most powerful electric washer I've used."

        "text": "I've gone through a few power washers.  I don't use them often, so I don't get new ones to replace a broken one, just usually I see one and it has a feature I'd like, so I give my old one to a friend or family member, and get the new one.This one looked interesting when it came up in the Vine program, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was winter time when I ordered it, and living in Wisconsin with the winter we've had, I've got so much salt in the garage that I've never seen it look like this before.  In about a 2 foot oval around the entire area the car sits, it's like a small white beach, there are literally small salt dunes in many places.This was probably the biggest pain of any I have purchased to unbox and put together.  There are 19 pieces you pull out, 21 if you count the two wheel covers that were slipped on the wheels but not fully in place yet, and had to be removed to put the wheels on anyway.  Some things didn't line up very easily and required a bit of force to get them into place, and this was mostly due to the barrels the screws went through not going into the holes set in the receiving piece without a bunch of elbow grease and slightly bending things to align them.  There's a little design quality there they could improve upon.I don't like that the connector for the hose is all plastic.  Plastic for the screw threads, plastic for the little rollers that pop out to secure it to the nozzle on the power washer, just plastic plastic plastic.  I've had far too many of these break in the past from other manufacturers. I also don't like the wand's connector.  The hose from the washer to the wand actually slides up inside a deep recessed hole with a cover totally shrouding it.  The hose has to line up a specific way, because of the shape of the plug on it, and there is no marking on the hose to show &#34;line up with this spot&#34; on the wand.  So you have to look into the &#34;tunnel&#34; on the hose to the hole inside, see where the parts are supposed to be lined up, then get the hose oriented this way, and then push it up inside while maintaining that orientation.  Slightly cocking it to one side or the other will mean you won't get it inserted.  So there's some give and take there.  Most places just use round retaining flanges that can be inserted regardless, but this one is rectangular, so it HAS to go in the right way.I was able to do a good stress test of the unit for my first run though, cleaning out that aforementioned garage full of salt and gunk from the winter roads here.  Since we've had an insanely brutal winter compared to normal for the last couple decades, between more snow and more days below zero, we've used a LOT of salt on our roads.  Now that we're in April, and I finally saw a day break 50 degrees, I thought I would finally clean my garage.  Since I didn't even have hoses outside yet, and the faucets outside are still turned off, I bought a short 15 foot hose to run from my wash tub in the laundry room off my garage to the power washer, and just snaked the hose through the garage door and left it open.Once I got past the reset safety on the plug, I saw that it had apparently been shipped in the &#34;on&#34; position.  It's a large 3&#34; or so circle on the BOTTOM of the front of the washer that rotates to turn this on and off.  I like the large oversized swtich, I just don't like the position.  So I got it going, and spent some time working on the concrete floor in my garage.It performed very well, as good as any power washer I've had in the past, and actually better than most.  On/Off with the wand's handle was quick and flawless.  I know my stationary tub does not put out as much water as quickly when compared to the hose bibs outside.  I've had other power washers when, using something with less than &#34;full water&#34; flow like I was using today, would kind of squirt out a little water until you released the handle on the wand, pulled it, released it, and pulled it again, getting enough water pressure to the pump again, and finally the pump would kick in again and it would start actually using power.  I've had that happen here previously using this very stationary tub.  But it never happened once with this unit.  Full power the entire time despite the lesser inflow of water to the unit.Noise levels were about on par with any power washer I've ever owned.  The hose straightened out easily when I &#34;unscrewed&#34; it by twisting the wand to get rid of all the spirals in it from being rolled up, it didn't try to hold it's old &#34;wound&#34; position like many do.  The hose seems to be better than most of the really bad plastic feeling hoses the other washers I've had used.The wand twists to give you control over the size of the spray, and there's a setting for using the detergent mixer as well.  That was another piece of this that just disappointed me as far as the poor engineering.  The instructions show clearly that you are supposed to run the line from the top back of the power washer to the detergent container underneath the handle where this snaps in.  But if you do that, it would kink the unit.  going to the side wasn't a good option either.  I ended up pulling the little line apart and feeding it through one of the other cutouts in the handle, since that way it wasn't compressed and didn't interfere with getting the container on and off.  I've posted a couple pictures of what I'm talking about so you can see what I mean.I also miss the wind up crank my other one had, since there was a hose reel built into the top of it.  But ultimately I prefer this one since as I said, the hose doesn't seem to be forcing itself to stay in a coiled up spiral shape, I can actually get this completely straight and flat while I'm using it.  I find that far more useful than an easy way to roll it up when I'm done.The AC cord has plenty of length, and the hose is a usable length as well.All told, this is a good little unit.  Engineering issues would've made me give this just 3 stars most likely if it performed as adequately as the other power washers I've used in the past, but I had to give it another star for how well it actually worked.  It had no problems stripping the gunk off my concrete floor, or the Weathertech floor mats of my Jeep, or even the floor mats I dragged outside to hose down now that the winter season has mostly passed us up.  If it weren't for how the hose has to line up just the right way without being able to visually see it while you do it for the connector to the wand, or the assembly issues with things not lining up right before you screwed them in, the performance would've earned this 5 stars.  So it balances out to 4, and it's certainly earned all of them."

        "text": "I was thrilled to be given the opportunity to use and review this item! We have a deck that requires frequent cleaning because we have bird feeders, and truth be told they are too close to the deck - so the deck gets icky, and I hate it!My husband has a power washer, but it is an older model that looks very impressive and requires more muscle than I have in order to move it. He kept telling me he would  show me how to use it, but when using this Karcher power washer became a possibility I was thrilled that I would have a power washer of my own, and, best of all perhaps, in a size that I could manage.I only really used the vario-speed wand. The &#34;dirt-blaster&#34; wand offers seriously strong power, power, washing capability, and it would easily tackle your yuckkiest cleaning task. I  hesitated to try to use the dirt blaster on the siding of the house bcause the 'vario-speed' wand did a perfect job (at a lower than max speed), and I have a feeling that the dirt-blasting wand would take off all of the paint on the siding in a hurry!Fllowing are the pros and con of setting up and using this mighty little power cleaner.Pros:1.  This relatively petite unit does a wonderful job!I got my deck cleaned  (and it was very gunky after a large part of the winter) in no time! I used the vario-speed handle and it was perfect. Even with the relatively poor water pressure that we have at our house, I got a v-e-r-y powerful amount of pressure. Using the vario-speed handle at full pressure blasted bird bath ick in a flash and then, by changing the pressure, let me fill the bird bath easily. It blasted the seeds and gunk that were stuck in between the decking effortlessly! That was really important because I had been having to use a machete knife to clean out in between the decking boards before, which was time cosuming and very discomforting for me.2.  It's portable and the low 30# weight makes it easy to move about as needed.3.  The cords are generously long, I had no problems at all covering a large area without the need to move the unit itself.4.  Because of its compact size, this Karcher power cleaner is easy to cover and store.5.  Having the 'cleaning solution' cannister option makes washing your car so easy! Just add the solution to the cannister, attach the siphon hose and voila - you have your own little car-ash (or patio furniture washer etc.). It's a very handy feature of the unit.6.  With the exception of the banging the wheels in place, I was able to put the unit together by myself. Putting the hoses into place is easy enough and the unit performs flawlessly and easily.Cons:1.  As others have mentioned, the instructions for the assembly are not very good. They took a lot of reading, and re-reading to make sense to me. I got it, however, it just took a bit of time, and, for a change, I really did need to actually r-e-a-d the instructions.2.  The wheels were especially difficult to set, and this is the one thing that I did need to ask my husband for help with. His muscle power was needed to get the wheels pushed in.3.  The wheels are not very effective in general. They help, but they are v-e-r-y stiff and turn all that well.4.  The handle is not very comfortable. I wish that you keep the flow going without having to hold in the handle constantly. I can live with it though. The handle itself is not ergonomic and, as a person who has already had carpal tunnel surgery once, I would have appreciated a better design for the handle and more padding! I plan to construct some sort of cushioning for myself. If you have no issues with your hands or wrists, then this will be no issues for you!5.  The yellow part of the front of the unit that holds the &#34;cleaning solution&#34; cannister is a bit flimsy, and does not attach as securaly to the unit as I would like.Yes, there are quite a few small things that I consider to be 'cons', but the fact of the matter is that this power washer is really perfect for me, and I am thrilled to have it. I will be using it a lot I know. I am so happy that I will not have to master the monster machine that is my husband's old model power washer!For me the pros of this washer make the cons seem like small things. For the money, I truly don't think that you can do any better. I think that the cons are all 'doable'. I took one star off because of the handle design. That's really the only thing I plan to fiddle with to make more comfortable. Those people who experience no hand or wrist problems will have no issues with the handle!This little powerhouse is an excellent value all-in-all and I think that it will be a very useful tool for anyone who needs a good power washer at a very reasonable price point!"

        "text": "I was looking for an electric pressure washer for home use after having had a lot of success with an AR Blue Clean AR383 that I had purchased for work.  When I saw this unit I thought I would give it a try.  Here is what I like:1.  The pressure hose is fairly flexible and the power cord is very flexible.  These may seem like small items, but it they are stiff and difficult to work with it can turn a quick task into a real pain.2.  The motor in this unit works well and it seems to create a good amount of pressure.3.  The bright yellow color makes it difficult to trip over!!4.  Only one tool, a number two Philips screwdriver, is required for assembly.5.  The gun assembly on this unit has a much better attachment mechanism for the pressure hose than the AR383 does.Here is what I did not like as much:1.  As opposed to the AR Blue Clean AR383, this unit requires a lot of time to put together!  Allow yourself an hour to assemble this unit as the parts do NOT fit well.  Be especially careful when putting the top section on to the body of the unit as it does NOT go together easily.  The plastic parts do NOT align well and it will take quite a bit of force to get them to fit together (the top slides into the bottom section, if you apply sufficient amount of force) and if you are not careful you can wind up with a pinched hand or finger!!!2.  As opposed to the AR Blue Clean AR383, the ergonomics, fit, and finish of this machine leaves a lot to be desired.  As an example, on the AR383 the handle is finished on all sides.  This makes for a very comfortable grip when you move the unit or if you have to lift it up.  On the Karcher unit, the handled is only finished on the top and forward facing side.  The back of the unit is open plastic that is VERY rough on your hands and not very comfortable.3.  While the wheels of this unit are larger than those on the AR383, they are basically worthless.  They do NOT roll without a lot of force because the wheels have no real support.  There is no shaft that they are connected to.  They are attached to the body of the unit with a press fit piece of plastic that is not stable.  So, the wheels may roll if there is no weight on them, but apply weight and the plastic bends and the wheels rub on the unit or just do not turn.  Since these wheels are plastic, expect them to wear out quickly due to sliding and not turning on surfaces.4.  The quick disconnect is a joke.  It is a VERY frail piece of plastic that does not connect well.  I had mine disconnect twice while the unit was in use (happened when I shut off the spray).  I would highly recommend buying a higher quality connector because if this comes disconnected while the pump is running you can ruin the motor since it is basically water cooled and water lubricated.Overall, this unit is functional and does work as long as you are either very careful with the quick disconnect or if you replace it with a decent one.  However, I do not see where it delivers a $100 worth of higher performance of gives value for the money you need to spend over and above what an AR Blue Clean AR383 gives you.The two star deduction is for Value, quality of fit and finish, and lousy wheels.I would Not recommend this unit."

        "text": "I love Karcher's pressure washers. They are quality PWs that deliver depending upon your needs. For my needs, the best PW is the Karcher G 2650 gas-powered Honda engine pressure washer. This 2,000 psi electric pressure washer is, by comparison, almost a toy. But to be fair, it's a nice, light, easy to use little thing. If you just want to wash the car and spray some dirt from a small porch, it may be perfect for you. By contrast, my pressure washing needs are significant. I live with a lot of animals and a lot of hard, exterior surfaces and everything gets dusty or muddy by turns. A good, powerful pressure washer is essential unless I want to spend half a day hosing down sidewalks, patios, and driveway. My gas-powered Karcher gets the job done FAST. This little electric unit is hardly more powerful than my garden hose turned full force and equipped with a good pistol grip spray nozzle. And there are all those hoses to move thither and yon. Admittedly only one more hose than the gas-powered washer has, but for me with all the space I have to cover, it's the hose that broke this camel's back. To its credit, the Karcher 2,000 psi electric is easier to start, easier to lift, and more convenient to power. So, if your need is for a relative lightweight, it likely will do the job. But don't be misled, if you've got a lot of ground (concrete, stone, etc.) to cover, you may need what I need, the Karcher 2,650 psi gas-powered model."

The problem was more that the machining had virtually no tolerance, and it thus required a lot of hand strength at several points to get the thing put together.  Second: though the electrical ground fault tester indicated that there was not a problem and though we tried plugging the device into several different outlets, we could not get the motor to turn on.  We followed all the fail safe hints and suggestions.  But: no go.We will try taking the device over to the more modern house of friends to see whether the problem is a function of our old house and old electrical service or something in the device itself.  But...in either case....we're most unlikely to wind up a power washer that works and can actually be used for jobs we need it for."

        "text": "A trimmer that's really light weight, mows, and is cordless? Fantastic! But...when it works it's great....but it's getting it to work that is the tricky part. It is so light weight that it's great for tiny yards, steep hillsides, or for the elderly or younger kids to use. It's a less dangerousness mini mower with the deck on. You just make sure the lithium battery is completely locked in, push a button and squeeze the handle. As an edger it works well too but with no shields attached watch out for your bare ankles getting hit by debris.The problems: let's start with the battery's. Each battery only lasts 15-20 minutes tops depending upon grass length. So if you have any sizable job it would take you forever to get it done. Especially since each battery then takes about 4 and a half hours to recharge. So 9 hours of charging for 30-40 minutes of work time. Out of the box my husband and I used this as a mower. We each used both batteries once, so there was a recharge between uses. Then I went to recharge the batteries only to get the flashing red light signal that indicated overheating. We tried this off and on for over 24 hours plugging the charger in inside the house. Finally I emailed Black and Decker who responded with a statement that I should be charging them in a cool area ( it was mid May and our house was no warmer than 71) but that since I had a time period I needed to review this in I could take it to their service center an hour away. We went out of our way to get there to be told that this was a known battery problem, they were in a minor redesign and we would have new batteries in about ten days. The new ones finally came- and still when we went to charge them the same overheat signal came on and the batteries wouldn't charge. So another trip to the service center where they finally decided it was the fault of the charger. A new one was ordered. But a second set of batteries showed up instead. So those then had to be mailed back and wait for the charger some more. Now that the waiting game is over the trimmer/ mower is great as long as it has that tiny amount of juice but from my perspective this product still needs a lot of work to make it better for the user."

I have many pieces of equipment including a large ride-on mower, a self-propelled push mower, and a walk behind heavy duty weed eater (gas powered, but not self propelled.These pieces of equipment are all great for various uses, but the one thing that I had trouble with was a large section of my front yard that is on a steep incline where none of the other equipment could be easily or safely used. When we tried the other equipment, we would end up with large ruts which would then end up leading to erosion of the hillside where the grass had been torn up.This little piece of equipment was perfect. It is very light weight and the lithium battery packs will allow for a decent amount of mowing/trimming, especially if you have both packs fully charged. I love the mower desk as it enabled me to more easily do large sections than if I had to use it as a regular weed whacker.It seems fairly high quality for the price. I am always leery of plastic, but that's what keeps it lightweight. We will see how it holds up and if I have any issues with durability, I will update."

The trimmer is not heavy. The trick, if there is one, is to keep the trigger pulled while going back and forth over the area getting trimmed.The mower attachment is easy to clean - can be hosed down. I use up a battery is a LOT less than half an hour, maybe because I'm holding the trigger the whole time.The continuous line feed helps a lot.

        "text": "Having used gas trimmers, and both corded and cordless trimmers over the years, I was very impressed with how lightweight this trimmer is, and the power and battery life it has. With its 2 batteries and tiny toy mower attachment, you could get away without a mower if you have a cute little postage stamp yard.I have Black & Decker's previous cordless electric trimmer, the 18V Grass Hog, and it is, frankly, awful. After a few disappointing uses (it's heavier, weaker, and with a shorter battery life and even longer charging time than this trimmer), it got put aside and we switched back to the gas trimmer (or, more accurately, I quit trimming altogether when my partner's away, as I hate the noise, smell, weight, difficulty starting and intense vibrations of the gas trimmer).I've used this trimmer all over our property, for standard lightweight edging of a maintained lawn, for crisis &#34;mowing&#34; of a severely overgrown (tall grass and heavy weeds) large courtyard, and for trimming paths around water and fences in tallgrass pasture. I've used the little &#34;mower&#34; attatchment on both high and normal grass. It's great on regular grass, workable on overgrown.It's great. Light as-is, easy on your back, hands and shoulders. Doesn't require a kung-fu grip to start or keep on, and with the mower attachment, it weighs nothing and you can operate it with one hand with the same effort you'd need to run an ultralight vacuum.I like that it comes with 2 batteries and uses the same battery as other B&D; tools in the same line (I had another battery from a little cordless chainsaw we got for Christmas). I found all 3 batteries to have the following life:-20 minutes on light edging--what you have around the edges if you mow every week-15 minutes on taller grass and heavy trimming (medium weeds, mid-calf-high grass)-10 minutes on every heavy weed and tough, stemmy pasture grass over the kneesIf you let your big, tough weeds get to your waist (which is true on much of our property, which includes a lot of pasture woods), or you have woody weed and vines, this trimmer is going to have trouble. But then, I don't think any trimmer's going to do well with stems an inch around.The one negative is that the batteries do take a long time to charge--4+ hours each, and there's just one charger. We have a charging station where we keep all our tool and regular  batteries charged and ready to go, so it wasn't a problem for me, but would have been in the days before we had our little dedicated charging area. B&D; does make a fast charger (40 minutes--http://www.amazon.com/Black-Decker-L2ACF-OPE-Lithium-Charger/dp/B009NOCWY6/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1403104470&sr;=8-1&keywords;=black+and+decker+20v+lithium+charger) that I will probably nab in the future.All in all, I was well pleased to have an edger that did a good job, had sufficient battery life for all our normal trimming, and didn't leave my back aching or my hands numb."

        "text": "The main trimmer works great, self-feeds without a problem, is fairly light, and does a great job of trimming anywhere you can't reach with your lawnmower.  I especially appreciate that it comes with two batteries.  We've never had to wait to use the trimmer because of this (but just one of the batteries typically lasts us through a couple of lawn sessions).  It's also handy that the charger is a trickle charger; you can leave the battery on there so it's always ready to go, and you don't have to worry about ruining it by overcharging it.  The batteries can be used interchangeably with other B&D; products that use 20-volt batteries.The mowing deck is easy to use and, with it, you can do an adequate job of mowing your lawn.  It would be perfect for tiny yards or remote patches that you don't want to lug your full-size mower to.  It would also be great for anyone who needs their mower to be lightweight.  Otherwise, you're really going to be better off with a mower.  If you only need the trimmer, tryBlack and Decker's LST420 Trimmer and Edger, which appears to be basically the same product, but without the mowing deck."

        "text": "-- UPDATE#2 --Well after taking it for a complete spin around our yard, two batteries are definitely needed. I was able to achieve 20-30 minutes max. After about half way the power started to drop and we had to swap batteries to complete the job. Keep in mind this was only string trimming around 1500 linear feet of edging (approximately). This is definitely not going to replace my Tanaka string trimmer, but I'll grab it in a pinch to do some quick trimming or touchups.-- UPDATE#1 --Quick tip for people using it as a mower, it's best if you mow like you would vacuum (back and forth). That and mow a bit more often than you normally would to prevent it from getting bogged down.Also, I highly recommend usingGrez-Offto clean the mower deck and trimmer with after every use as it removes every bit of pulverized grass with ease.Right off the bat assembly and getting the trimmer adjusted was easy and straight forward. Just a single screw was required to get the guard in place and it was ready to go.After charging one of the batteries for a few hours (as required), it was time to take it for a spin. Nice and quiet operation, plenty of power to cut down 12\"+ grass with ease. With the adjustable telescoping handle I was able to get it to fit me as well as my shorter family members.The single button adjustable grip handle allows for a great amount of control and again was able to get it into a position that fit my trimming needs.The 20V battery seems to be holding quite well and gives me plenty of run time to complete our 1/3 acre lot (will update this review as to any changes in the battery charge/run time).Now as for the mower... it has got to be a joke. This would only be useful for someone who lives in the city and only has to take care of a patch or two of sidewalk grass every week.The height adjustment is lacking and clumsy.The \"mower deck\" on the bottom is just cram packed with nooks, crannies, and areas where grass gets packed in making it harder to clean.The only thing that the deck portion has that is useful, is a ring for hanging it when not in use (something I wish the trimmer had...).So if you have a small patch of grass (or two) to upkeep, this will definitely help you out. However if you have a bit more land to mow, buy just the trimmer because it's awesome!"

The batteries were so huge that it really weighed down the handle and my arm would sometimes be sore by the time I finished the yard.  The batteries also didn't last more than 10-15 minutes and the power level would sometimes get lost when in storage in between each job.  I like this model much more because of the lithium batteries.  The product is much easier to hold for longer periods of time, and it seems more powerful than even the 24v model.  It also lasts longer.  I haven't had a job last more than 20 minutes and the battery lasts the entire time, whereas the 24v version would take two batteries to finish the job.  It is nice that this version comes with two batteries as well.The mower attachment is a neat little idea.  It makes trimming larger areas much easier because you don't have to hold up the entire trimmer the whole time and because you get a more level cut.  It has two cutting levels and it is easy to attach and detach the trimmer to it.I'm much happier with this model than I was with the 24v version with the huge batteries.  It makes the work much easier."

        "text": "First off - I live in the south and we have St. Augustine grass - when using this as a mower, even assuming you want to mow your yard 12 inches at a time, this is too short even at the highest setting for St. Augustine grass.  Maybe if you have bermuda or some other variety it might do the trick for tiny yards.As a weed whacker, again, I have to say it is so so.  This is a lightweight yard tool - the batteries are small and it really feels under-powered to me, but I am used to using a 36volt li-ion trimmer that can go thru absolutely anything i throw it at.  For the first edging of the season, you'll have a really hard time getting a nice clean line with this tool. This tool, while a clever design, is really only suitable for small yards that are consistently maintained.  The only thing I can really say that I like about it, is the edger guide, which goes against the sidewalk to guide not just placement, but also depth, the guide has a little bump out that sits on top of the sidewalk so that you aren't going down too deep and wasting a bunch of trimmer line.I have always like black and decker yard products because they are light enough and sized appropriately for a small woman to do her own yard work - a big plus in my book, and this tool is no exception. However, putting the guard on during first assembly out of the box was unreasonably difficult - I couldn't get it to snap into place no matter how hard I pushed.  I had to wait for my husband to get home and get him to do it.  Big fail.  Why should it  be so difficult to put together that I have to ask my husband for help?Once you get past that difficulty, the rest of this product is dead simple to use and nice and lightweight. I just wish it had a little more power, and I wish it would have come with one longer lasting battery as opposed to two small ones."

        "text": "This is a clever idea - if you have a certain type of little &#34;yard&#34; you are familiar with trying to mow it with a string trimmer.  Sometimes you overswing into the adjoining plants, sometimes you kick up a divot...  But what if you could just slot the trimmer into a wheeled frame that would keep it level, maybe height-adjustable?  Voila!Of course you're not covering as much grass as a blade-mower: you're limited to the length of the string.  That's a max cutting radius of 6&#34; here, though I guess beyond that the string would be kicking around anyway.  And in this case it's lithium-battery powered, which is what it is - currently about 15 minutes a charge (new battery...)  However it's LOTS lighter than any reel mower I've ever carried, easier to use, more effective, and far more convenient to store.For my old &#34;yard,&#34; a cascade of little terraces on an urban slope, this would've been PERFECT.  For my current yard, which is convenient to external outlets, corded would be better, and cheaper in the long run.  But on the whole, this has been very useful so far.  It all depends on how long the MTC220, its batteries (and the string) lasts."

It's not as powerful as a plug-in trimmer or a gas trimmer so you really need to keep up with the edging. Also, when twisting it into edging mode I have two issues. First, the wire metal guide is difficult and frustrating to pull out. The old B&D model has one that just flips out which is much better. Second, as you twist the end to put it into edger mode the metal rod tends to come completely loose. With my small lawn this trimmer's battery lasts more than long enough. It just doesn't have the power of a plug in model so expect that before you buy. If you were using this to clear the edge of a field with tall weeds I'd say look at something else. For grass this is fine. For weeds you'd have a struggle.. The mower part of this is just a gimmick. I cannot understand, unless you had a lawn for ants, how this would make a good mower. I gave it a good try but it's super-frustrating to use. If you don't have a mower it's best to mow using it like a trimmer than to hook it up to this silly contraption. I'd give this a full five stars but the goofiness of the mower attachment and the other items knock one star off."

        "text": "My upfront summary - a good mower that cuts my grass quite well, the grass catcher works okay but not perfectly, and the cord wasn't nearly as difficult to keep out of the way as I had expected.  If you have the ability to get a cord out to everywhere you want to cut grass, I think this is worth considering.  Larger lawns can also benefit if you want to avoid gas because you won't run out of juice when you have it plugged in versus running off of a battery.  It's not perfect, it's a little bulky compared to what I'm used to, and the handle height isn't adjustable (on mine, even though the pictures on Amazon show it is) - so if it doesn't fit you, you're out of luck.  If you're still interested :), I have more details below.Living in the desert, I have a smaller lawn that is about 600 square feet (around 20 by 30 feet).  So, definitely not a huge lawn.  Even so, I've put off buying a corded electric mower for years because I thought it would be a real hassle to deal with a power cord, and I thought the risk of slipping up and slicing the cord with the mowing blade were too high.  I always gravitated to wanting a battery-based model, but those have their own issues (heavier, can't mow if you forgot to charge the battery, batteries only last so long).  After growing up in Illinois and using a gas mower for many years, I just don't want one of those.  After reviewing the directions, I saw that B&D; had a diagram showing the recommended mowing pattern to make it easier to keep the cord out of the way - and it worked great for me!  Probably common sense, but I was so used to the way that I'd always mowed my lawn, it hadn't occurred to me to do it that way.  So, if you get one, check out the directions - it made using a cord a lot easier for me, and it alleviated a lot of the hassles that I had expected to encounter.There are a variety of mowers out there: gas, electric with cords, electric with batteries, and push reel.  I'd like to compare this to a push reel because for fourteen years, I've been using a reel mower much like thisAmerican Lawn Moweron Amazon.  Most reel mowers aren't fancy, but they can cost under $100, take up very little floor space, and work quite well if you don't let your grass get too long.  What mine doesn't do, but you can buy models that do, is catch the grass clippings.  What this B&D; brings to the table versus my reel mower is a much more even cut, it catches the grass, and it handles long (higher than 6\") grass with ease.  The end result is a cleaner looking lawn.  The drawbacks are it takes a lot more floor space in my garage, it's heavier and bulkier so it's more difficult to carry around to my lawn (I don't wheel it because the rest of my yard is rock), and it takes longer to get started because I have to get the cord all set up and in place.In the end, I really like the more consistent cut and reduced mowing effort from this B&D; versus my reel mower, but I might like even better the smaller footprint in my garage and reduced time it takes from start to finish with the reel mower.  So, for those of you with smaller lawns, I recommend that you at least consider a reel mower - but for those of you looking at corded mowers, I do recommend giving this model your consideration.  If you have any questions, please feel free to leave a comment and I'll respond as quickly as I can.Pros:(*) It's a Black & Decker.  I've purchased a number of their electric lawn care items (blower/vac, pole saw, chain saw), and I've overall been happy with the build quality of them.  This mower is no exception(*) Handles long (at least six inches) grass with no problems(*) Very even and consistent cut(*) Super easy (and I mean super) change between cutting lengths.  I can't get over just how effortless it is to move the lever and adjust it.  I love it(*) Decently quiet.  Kind of like a hair dryer.  Louder than my reel mower, but by no means painfully or annoyingly loud(*) Safety bar on the handle will turn on blade if you let go of the handle(*) Fairly lightweight for a mower, given the extensive use of plastics(*) Has a built-in cord loop on the lower handle to store your extension cord right on the mower.  If you have a spare cord to use just with this mower, that is a very handy feature(*) Won't run out of power because it's cordedCons:(*) The vent holes all around the grass box let a lot of dust and dry clippings out.  The box does catch most of the grass, but it spits out a good deal of small particles(*) The handle on mine only had one set of holes, so the height is not adjustable.  It fits my height (5'9\") okay, but I'd like to be able to adjust it lower.  If you're shorter than me, this might be a problem(*) Takes up a lot more floor space in the garage than my upright reel mower, so finding a place for it was more difficult.  Not a con if you've got plenty of room or are replacing another similarly-sized mower(*) It's always attached to a power cord.  Yep, that's both a pro and a con :)Notes:(*) It comes mostly assembled, which is nice, but getting it all together might take a little patience.  Putting the grass box together was a real pain for me.  The dark plastic halves aren't overly rigid, but you need to get a number of tabs lined up and snapped into place - which isn't easy when the halves are flexing and moving the tabs out of alignment.  One of my tabs was out of alignment, but I eventually got it massaged into place using a screwdriver.  It took much longer than I had expected.  Once done, though, it's easy to insert and remove the grass box from the main mower.  Also, one of the screws to get the handle attached took some doing to get it to catch the threads on the recessed hole"

        "text": "** updated with second mow at bottom**I really do enjoy mowing my yard... it's a little more than  1/3 acre and a push mower is good exercise.  My other mower is a 13 year old Toro Recycler 22\" deck with personal pace self-propelled drive.  I've kept that gas engine purring and it's still running strong - Briggs and Stratton make a good engine.  But... it is loud (I mow with ear buds or plugs in) and it's considered not as \"green\" as some current options.  So even though I'm a happy Toro gas mower owner... I thought I'd give an electric a chance.A quick pros and cons for the start here...  remember that I've only assembled and mowed once with it....+ Very light - this is a mower my 6 year old could handle (and no... I don't let her mow).+ packaged mostly assembled - only two Philips head screws to anchor the handle.  The rest is tool-less.+ Significantly quieter than my gas engine mower.  I don't have a SPL gauge, but I can mow without protection and wouldn't get a headache-  17\" deck is a bit narrow.  It sure fits in the garage easy, but I'm adding an additional swipe after every 3 passes to keep up with my 22\" gas mower.  Will be a bit more exercise... and a lawn pattern with more wheel marks.-  Not self-propelled... perhaps this is an observation more than a Con...  It's light, so it doesn't feel like it needs a drive system-  Mostly plastic construction - long term durability?-  Wheels seem less rugged than ones designed for steel deck mowers.Now that we are past the bullets...  Assembly...well the handle attaches with two screws and the upper handle with two tool-less bolts with a hand side wingnuts... they all work well and provide a study feel when complete.The fancy plastic grass catcher comes in 4 pieces...  that's right... 4!  I spent more time inserting tab A into slot B than should be necessary.  The grass catcher is a work of functional art.  Two tone, with a compactor arm built into the unit.  It's a great concept in lawn tech.  I have some concerns over the long term strength over the 4 piece unit versus a molded one piece.  Time will tell if those tabs maintain their strength.  Some additional concerns are the weight.  The plastic catching unit is obviously heftier than a fabric catcher and when full and compacted with grass -- It's likely going to be a lot heavier than the motor deck.  The first spring mow was more of a top off cut than a normal full cut, so I didn't get to witness if the lack of weight in the mower deck and the ability to compact a lot of grass in this catcher turn into a big negative in keeping an even cut through less than ideal slightly bumpy terrain.From a grass catching perspective, it appeared to have less of a \"suction\" than my Toro gas unit.  It would go over leaves without pulling them up into the catcher,  perhaps this will improve when the height of the grass increases, but it's a noticeable different to the gas mower.  Mowing without the catcher in place is possible, but doesn't produce a mulching action when doing a light cut - I will check this again when the grass is higher for the next cut.The front edge of the mower has a molded handle built into the unit.  I'm really not sure of why it's there - the top handle makes more sense.  But with garage space a premium, it looks a great place to use a hook and pulley to pull this mower up and hang it on the wall like my other electric yard tools...  unlike a gas engine; I don't have to worry about it spilling out oil or gas...The height of the mower is changed using a single handle adjustment behind the rear left wheel (its orange in the picture).  When the mower is raised and lowered, the cut gauge on the side reads out in inches...  I think it's great that it is simplified to not have to move each wheel to change height.  Much more user friendly.  My only concern with this method of raising the cut is that it is only raising the back end of the mower to achieve this height, putting the cutting blade at an angle.  This isn't as much of an issue on the grass in the middle of the cut, but the edge cuts won't be at the same even height due to the blade angle.  I don't yet have full enough grass to check the impact of raising it all the way up to 3\"...  but I'm interested in hearing others experiences with cut quality due to this function.The blade had a factory edge on it, which is normal for all mowers...  I'll be giving it a 90 degree sharp edge before the next mow...Handling... I'm used to a heavy mower, doing a little bit of \"Tokyo Drifting\" with a self-propelled unit to slide into the end cuts and radius cuts.  The much lighter deck of this unit is definitely a different feel and seems easy to lift the mower off of its cut angle/depth.  I had to consciously change the way I'm putting pressure on the handle to keep the deck down in walking turns.The balance of the mower feels a little off...  with very little weight in the electric engine and deck and the handle being attached over the rear wheels,  the additional weight of the catcher (especially when full) makes it unbalanced causing the front wheels to easily rise on a bumpy area...  This leads to an uneven cut.  Moving the handle attachment an inch or two forward of the rear wheels should make this tool feel more stable and cut more uniformly.And the biggest difference between gas and electric... the cord.  I've used electric dethatchers and other devices in which you have to be cord conscious, so it didn't cause me too much issue.  But it is a significant consideration in how you mow versus a gas (cordless) mower.  Your mowing pattern has to be cord friendly... and your cord needs to be long enough to support your mowing swipes.  Cord management adds time to the mowing cycle, and even though it was out of the way most of the time, cords get caught up in my shrubs and plants, requiring adept lasso maneuvers to prevent walking to move a cord.Summary?  It's okay.  It may be durn perfect for a very small yard - but that's not my yard.  Even with a light early spring cut, it took enough time additional to the gas mower that it was noticeable - But that's really to be expected when you are dealing with a thinner deck 17\" vs 22\" and power cord management.  The jury is still out on the cut quality - I will add to the review as the grass thickens up.  But the height adjustment angled method is concerning me.  The unit is quieter and gives me green \"street cred\"  if you ignore the fact that Ohio power comes from burning coal...  I'll improve this review as I continue to use the unit this next month.  For now the Gas Toro mower is still hibernating.******Second mow this week at 3\"...  The grass grew like the preferred weed that it is last week with all of the rain.  This time i added a 25' extension cord to my 50' cord to prevent unexpected loss of power from ripping it out of the socket.  That seemed to make my range much more acceptable in swipes across the yard.In the much thicker grass, the lack of a drive engine and the plasticy light nature of the unit made it more difficult to keep a nice clean line. I may just be used to the control of the Toro that makes this easier - I'll mark it off to my lack of skill , but my lines were not very pretty.  Although I could hear the engine audibly bogging a little with the grass cut, the cut seemed clean and the catcher was doing its job.  I could not visibly tell while standing if the cut was uneven due to the height mechanism angling the blade, but getting down to the level of the grass low on my knees, it was visible.  So this mower will not have a straight even cut at max height...  that being said, at that height, such unevenness is hard to detect -- which is the compromise the engineers took for the ease of height adjustment.  At the lower height settings, the blade lowers to level, making a low cut the most even it accomplishes..  when it is the most noticeable.After mowing with it for about an hour, doing the cable dance, and emptying the unit several times... I finally returned to my Toro recycler.  Checked its oil, added gas, primed... and on the first pull it started right up, as if 6 months of dormancy never happened..  I finished the yard faster with the gas mower.So why did I give up?  As I was concerned the B&D; deck is too light.  When the heavy plastic grass catcher was just 3/4 full, it was so heavy that it could not even sit on its own four wheels due to being off balance.  It would fall back and rest on the grass catcher.  This lack of weight down on the front end of the mower leads to an uneven cut due to the front end bouncing, and me always pushing down the front to keep it cutting the grass.It's now hanging on the wall on my garage as a backup if my main mower has issues - but my recommendation is that this unit would only be best for those with very small yards and a willingness to deal with an evolving design that hasn't yet been perfected... to avoid having the maintenance and fuel requirements of a gas mower."

It represents quite a set of changes from mowers in the past:1) Lightweight, low profile and great handle bar. This mower weighs only 32 pounds because of its many plastic parts including the wheels. The bar is steel, making it easy to maneuver.2) Low profile and easy single lever height adjustment. The product photos barely do it justice in terms of showing the low profile. It's better to have a low profile for getting under shrubs. It also makes it feel like an edger when edging. The height adjustment allows selection of the cut from 11/10&#34; to 31/10&#34;.3) The bale switching compacts grass clippings and allows more grass to be collected between emptying. That saves time and effort.4) Comes with 2 year limited warranty. Several action may cause the warranty to be voided, such as changing the wheel size.5) B & D recommends that when the mower is off and unplugged, that the blades be wiped with a damp cloth.

Unfortunately the push mower, while it could be powered this way, would probably require a decent bank of batteries, adding weight and cost.  Someday we'll get there but not yet.Black & Decker get around the cost and the weight issue by just making you plug it in.  Now if you have a small yard, and don't want to handle the mess and maintenance of a gas powered lawn mower, or just concerned about weight, a plug in lawn mower might be a good choice for you.  The cord is a pain, and speaking of that, make sure you have one, since they don't include an extension cord with it.Black & Decker have always been more on the 'value' side when it comes to quality, and while there are some good features, it feels the quality is a bit lacking.  The good news is that you can pick it up cheap."

        "text": "I have a 6-year old corded mower from Home depot's own brand. It still runs fine, but its all metal construction makes it too heavy for moving around on tight corner during mowing. So, I am interested in trying out the light-weight corded mower from B&D.;Assembling the mower body itself is pretty easy, but putting together the grass collector box is quite a task that requires some handyman skills. Frankly, I think it's a design flaw. You need to assemble 4 pieces of hard plastic shells together to form the grass collector box. The process involves lining up several tabs for snapping them into the matching slots. But the tabs are not aligned and the plastic shell is pretty stiff to adjust. So, some brute force effort is needed. In a nutshell, it's a painful process to put together the grass collection box.This B&D; corded mower is far more lighter as it uses a lot of plastic material. It has a built-in cord loop on the lower handle bar for storing extension cord. Not sure if I want to dedicate a 50-feet cord just for this mower though.I try this mower couple of times. Though it's very light and quite, I know something is not quite right. It took me a while to realize the balance of this mower is off. The plastic shell construction make's it very light on the front deck. The long metal handler, plus the grass collecting box have quite some weight. When I run this mower, I keep getting into the condition that the front deck rises up. So, I end up having to intentionally hold the handler bar a little upward to prevent that from happening. Things are getting worse when the grass collecting box is half full, as it adds more weights and it is even more easier for the front deck to tip upward.One more thing that I don' t like this corded mower: the handle height is not adjustable. For me, the handle bar is a bit too high. On top of that, I have to intentionally hold the handle bar upward to prevent the front deck from tipping upward. So, after the mowing, my hand feel tired.At the end, I still go back to use my 6-year old Home Depot brand corded mower. I won't recommend this B&D; corded mower."

        "text": "I'm writing this review from the perspective of a fairly sedentary woman (i.e. not strong). Overall, I really liked the Black & Decker Corded Mower with Edge Max. It's quiet, easy to push and mows neatly. I got this mower out of the box, assembled--and mowed my entire front yard--within an hour!When I first opened the box, I was horrified--it looked like nothing was put together. I slowly began to assemble the grass catcher, and voila, I was able to lift the (assembled) mower out of the box WITH ONE HAND! It's quite light. Once the grass catcher is assembled, the rest goes pretty fast.However, while assembling the mower, I was disgusted with Black & Decker for their low standards: pieces that should have snapped together relatively easily took so much strength because of misaligned parts. They're like the opposite of LEGOs--pieces do *not* fit like a glove. In face, I needed a butter knife to help me push pieces together--more than once. I had to do both butt & chest presses on the grass catcher to have a couple of pieces finally snap into place. Thank goodness I did this in the privacy of my living room. I was sweating because of so much physical exertion (not the worst thing, mind you) to get that grass catcher put together correctly. Seriously, B&D;: Try Harder!Keep in mind: this does not come with a extension cord, so if you want to mow immediately, make sure you have a long one ready.The mower is so easy to push and control. I have used both gas power mowers and push mowers. This electric mower was the most pleasant mowing experience for me by far. The power one is hard for me to keep up with, and weights about as much as me. The push mower I used, a Fiskars mowers, was entirely abysmal: very hard to push and left your lawn looking like a terrible haircut.The one caveat I have is this: cords are a pain! Not just on this mower, but on all corded mowers. If I had the means, I'd totally buy an electric mower run on a battery. But for this low price, if you have the patience for a cord, this is a total deal. Drape the cord over your shoulder and not around your neck. Live and learn."

        "text": "I used this on a .5 acre lot with a good sized front yard and a small backyard (cluttered with pool, firepit, etc) and I am very, very impressed!Putting it together was a snap. I had it ready to mow in less than 5 minutes. (Not counting charging time). I charged the batteries in the evening and overnight. Then I started mowing by pulling the lever and pressing start. No pull! The cut is very clean and even and you should see it to understand how even it really is. Much better than my gas mower.I didn't use the grass catcher because I'd be dumping all the time. I didn't get grass on me anyway. The mulch dropped right down and didn't spray up. The mower is so light and easy to use that I was able to steer it with only one hand!I don't usually gush over these kinds of things but I showed my brother this mower and he bought one and was so impressed by this that he bought the blower and weed whacker as well! All of them work very well and we don't miss messing with gasoline mix and pull tabs to start!I did have to use two batteries to do my whole yard. You only get about 12-15 minutes of use on a battery charge. The extra batteries I got with the other items come in very handy. This is the only down side. If you have a small yard this wont impact you.I recommend this item highly!"

        "text": "My previous electric lawn mowers were some of my best purchases ever. I bought a Black and Decker and Neuton. I recommend both companies. A cordless electric mower transforms mowing. Gone are fumes, oil, maintenance, yanking, extreme noise. A messy, self-polluting, and environmental polluting endeavor is changed to a pleasant one.The CM1640 is so light that mowing is effortless. The 40volt battery weighs a fraction of my previous 36volt battery. The mower is extremely powerful and virtually weightless in feel. I'd prefer a 17 inch mower but the ease of mowing makes my lawn mowing done in a flash. With no pollution, no tuneups, just a nice, effortless glide.The cut adjustment is great. My only complaint is that I'd have liked the verstality to go bagless and use this as a mulching mower. I haven't tried it and I don't think it is designed to work this way.You get two batteries, they charge pretty quick. On a normal to slightly high height I can easily do my 1/8 acre lawn easily. I highly recommend electric mowers. This one is light enough that anyone can use it; kids, older folk, anyone. Extremely powerful, quiet, well-designed. Recommended."

        "text": "I use a riding mower to cut my lawn, but I also have a gas self propelled to cut areas where my riding mower can not get to.  The thing about gas is the maintenance.  You have to change the oil, storing gas, and sometimes difficult pull starts.  With battery, no need to do any of that stuff.  This mower is a breeze to start.  I like that you can have a battery charging while you use it and just be able to swap. My older Black and Decker electric had the battery built in and you had to plug it in to charge.This mower worked really great and was plenty powerful.  I do not let my grass grow too long and cut it at a min height of 3 inches.  The weight of this mower is not too bad, but a bit heavier than my gas one.  It is meant for smaller lawns, up to 1/8 of an acre and if your lawn is larger than that, you are better off with gas unless you want to wait around for the battery to charge.I have nothing bad to say about this mower and plan on using it all season, alternating between my gas and this.  I highly recommend it."

        "text": "Set up was easy and took about 15 minutes from unboxing, full assembly, and batteries on the charger. Build quality is decent, mostly very heavy duty plastics with some metal like the handle. The batteries chaged quickly and in about an hour I was out mowing. (It came with two batteries and I already had a charger so the process for me was faster then if I would have had just the one charger).I have the 36v weed whacker and also the 36v blower. My weed trimmer is going on summer number 3. That battery is what I used as my back up just to test if the older 36v would work (the manual says they will). That battery has spent two Minnesota winters in an unheated shed, so I figured it would give me a good idea of how long the batteries are lasting. To the naked eye the 36v and 40v batteries are indistiguishable.Cutting power was very good. My yard is a mix of grass, dandelions, and other assorted weeds. The mower went through everything without issue. It is very quite, almost like a fan running on a super high setting. Mower is light weight and easy to push. It says to use it with the enclosed grass catcher only, so I did but next time out I am going to try it without and hope it can mulch.My yard is about 150x50 so about 7,500 square feet. I figure I am mowing about 4500-5000 square feet of it once the house,shed, garage, and driveway are subtracted. It took 3 batteries to get it done. The newer 40v ones seemed to have more juice than my old 36v. I got two full bags out of the 40v and 1.5 bags out of the 36v. I actually thought the 36v did quite well and feel good about these batteries lasting for several years.  When the batteries die, they die and there is no loss of power over time. You pretty much go from full power mower to nothing instantly. Issue is that if you have a lawn needing 3 batteries and you just have the two, you will need to schedule in some downtime as the batteries get warm as they are used and the charger will tell you via red light flashes that they are to hot to charge. I swapped out my 40 for the 36, finished off the 36 and my 40 was still to warm to charge.Overall I really like his mower. It does have some battery limits on it if your yard is big enough you can't finish with the two supplied. (I have 4 batteries now so for me not a big deal), but it does very well considering it is basically runnning on a weed whip battery. It is light, quiet, no gas fumes, and leaves a nice even cut in your wake. Cutting width is pretty good as well. I am very happy with it. I will try and update on how my mulching experiment goes."

        "text": "I have some rental properties. When a property is vacant, I take careof the lawn. I have a corded mower, but I am tired of maintaining the cord.One time, I accidentally cut the cord while mowing. I have been thinking of getting a cordless mower, but that model has a heavy non-removable battery and the whole mower is way too heavy from transportation point of view.I am so happy to get this cordless mower with removable battery. I already have following 36-V cordless tools from B&D;: cordless line trimmer, cordless blower, and cordless hedge trimmer. To my surprise, this cordless mower from B&H; can take either 40V or 36V batteries. So, I have totally 5 batteries available for running this cordless mower.Majority of the construction material of this mower is thick plastic. With that, I would say the whole mower is a little on the flimsy side. However, that's good to me, as the mower is very light, not only from operation point of view, but also from transportation point of view. Even better yet, the whole handle bar can be easily collapsed down to take minimum space for both storage and transportation in my car.This mower is very quite, just like a fan running on high settings. The rear grass collecting bag is small but it is easy to remove and put back on. The light weight of this mower makes it easy to move around at tight corners.Some points need to be aware before choosing this cordless mower.One: each battery lasts about 15 minutes.Two: when a battery is fully drained, it usually is too hot to be charged. The charger will notify you on this and it won't start charging till the battery (inside) has cooled down. And each battery takes about one hour to be fully recharged. So, be expecting about 90-minute time for a fully drained battery to be available again.Three: It has limited power. When the grass is either too tall, or too dense, the motor will slow down. When the amount of grass is beyond its capability, the motor simply stops. Then, you have to release the button, wait for a minute and then re-start again. On the good side, it means there is no way you can burn the motor. On the negative side, it slows down your mowing work.All in all, as long as you are aware about the limitations of this cordless mower, I think it is a very good choice for properties with small lawns. I would definite recommend it to my friends."

        "text": "**** See update below for why I knocked it down to 2 stars.  Original review is here: ****I bought my first electric lawn mower when I bought my first house in 2004. It was a Black and Decker MM675 with a flip-over handle. That lawn mower served me well for about 5 years and never let me down. Then, one day I used it when my lawn was too wet and the motor started to smoke as it bogged down on wet grass! I could no longer get the MM675 model, so I went to Home Depot and \"upgraded\" to the MM1800, the 18\" corded mulching/bagging mower from Black and Decker. Immediately I was dissatisfied. It didn't feel as strong as my old mower, was more unwieldy, and had this awful plastic shroud that made it hard to maneuver. Everything on it felt cheap, and two years later, it died on me while mowing grass that was not that thick (the motor blew out and smoked).  I replaced it with aGreenWorks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerand never looked back - that was a great corded mower and I used it until I found this new B&D; Mower.For mowing my own lawn, I did not consider gas because I don't have the room to keep fuel around and I have a modest size yard. I have always relied on corded mowers because I felt the battery operated ones would be too weak and I didn't want to deal with battery management.  Cords are a fine option, but sometimes you do want the freedom of a battery.All of that being said, B&D; really did a nice job with this battery operated mower, and for the first time in my adult mowing life, I think I might be back to both B&D; (and using battery operation).Opening the box, I found the mower in 3 pieces.  The battery was pre-installed (with half-charge), so all I had to do to assemble the mower was attached the handle.  The handle attaches in 2 parts.  You need to unscrew the 2 bolts on each side and screw them back in, but once installed, they loosen with a simple lever.  This allows you to collapse the handle easily for storage.  I have had \"easy fold\" handles before, but this one is actually easy.  The mower is very light, and with a handle on top of the body of the mower, I was easily able to lift it up and put it away in my crawl space.  I could do that with a gas or my previous corded mower.The mower includes two 40V B&D; LBXR2036 Lithium Batteries.  It says it is compatible with the lower voltage 36V LBXR36 batteries, but gives no indication of the performance difference.  This could be important because the 36V batteries are $80 and the 40V are $110.  So understand that you are getting over $200 worth of batteries with this mower and that is likely where much of the cost lies.  The batteries are the new Lithium Ion batteries which should hopefully not hold memory like the old NiCad.  You also get a really nice charger which has \"smarts\" to let you know when a battery is charged.  Each battery also has a \"power gauge\" to let you know how much power is left.Enough about the batteries - how does it mow?  I went outside shortly after it rained for the first mow of the season.  Yes - I was challenging the mower on all fronts.  I plugged in the safety key (great feature to keep your mower off when you aren't around - it appears to be \"smart\" and won't let you just short out the terminals).  I also decided not to bag initially.  The deck height setting is very easy - a single lever adjusts the deck.  I tried on setting 2 and made it surprisingly far until I bogged down the mower (no surprise - the grass was tall and wet).  Most impressively, the mower stopped on tall grass and didn't burn out like my older corded mowers did.  It appears to know not to destroy itself.  You have to actually turn it off and then back on to get going, a nice feature to prevent you from overstressing the motor.  I set it higher (to 6) and mowed just fine.In terms of performance, I was able to mow my backyard with 1 battery and my front yard with the other.  Each worked for about 20 minutes (not quite the 30 advertised).  The mower cuts off quickly when the battery is dead, so no period of \"weak mowing\" when you're not sure if you should replace it.  When it's dead, it's dead.The bag is very easy to attach and you don't need to fight to keep it open like other bags.  It can't hold much, so you'll be emptying it a lot on heavy grass.A few other notes - the mower is very easy to turn and navigate thanks to the wide tires and oversized rear tires.  Unfortunately they are plastic (not rubber or real tires), but they seem to get the job done.  The mower is a total of about 17\" wide, so it will fit into very tight space, but it also means you might need to make more passes on your lawn than a wider mower.Overall, I was able to mow easily and certainly appreciated not having to handle cord management.  If you have a yard that can be mowed fully in 40 minutes and you don't want to mess with power cords, this mower is certainly a fine choice.  All of that being said, be aware that you can get a high quality corded mower (like the Greenworks 25022) for a little more than the cost of 1 battery for this mower.  It makes the decision an economic and personal one - is it worth twice the cost to you to get a mower that is lighter and does not require a cord?  If the answer is \"yes\", then you will be quite happy with this B&D; Mower.**** UPDATE 5/15/2014 ****Sadly I had to knock it down to two stars today.  While mowing, I hit a few rocks which is common around here (very rocky soil).  My old Greenworks mower has a few small dings on the blade from hitting rocks, but it's been going strong for years with the dings.  However, the small ding knocked the B&D; CM1640 totally out of balance.  It started vibrating and shaking while I mowed.  I hit a few more small rocks and it got worse.  These weren't giant rocks mind you, but small ones that I have accidentally mowed with countless other mowers.  As I pushed on, the mower caught a root and it was all over.  The blade literally bent 90 degrees (see photo I uploaded).  It is now trash.  Maybe you will tell me I should be more careful about rocks, and maybe you will tell me I should be more careful about roots?  Both are possible, but all I can say is that I abuse my Greenworks mower and every season it starts right up.  I have hit quartz, granite, and just about everything else in my yard, and it is still humming.So why do I think this happened?  I have a theory - it's a battery operated motor meaning they need to optimize everything to draw the lowest amount of current possible.  Looking at the blade, it appears they have made it thinner and lighter than a typical blade so it spins fast without drawing as much current.  The downside is what I just discovered - a fragile mower that breaks easily.One other thing I discovered - the batteries cannot be recharged immediately because they tend to get too hot.  The charger won't charge them.  So you can't recharge battery 1 while you mow with battery 2.  Another issue!I am going back to myGreenWorks 25022 12 Amp 20-in 3-in-1 Electric Lawn Mowerwhere you can read my review of that fine mower.  Once again I left it outside, under my deck, all winter, and it finished up my yard for me today great.  A few minutes with it reminded me why I left B&D; in the first place."

Sure your using home energy to charge the batteries, but you aren't using gas anymore, and thats pretty cool. If you have a small lawn and don't let the grass grow to high, then this is the right mower for you. Yes, you have to get out there every week or so to keep the lawn from getting to high, but its worth it in the end. I have a small beach house with just a small front lawn, and this is perfect for it. Assembly was straightforward, just stick to the script in the manual. The grass catcher must be attached which I knocked a star off of it for, so no cutting grass without it. It comes with two batteries and they last about 15-30 minutes each. It is very easy to start, and like I mentioned before, envirofriendly! Overall, I highly recommend this mower for those with a green conscious or those with small lawns."

I own a John Deere tractor which takes care of 90% of my mowing needs about the property.  However, the other 10% is landscaped and pathwayed and very difficult to maintain (especially in summer) with a string trimmer (my tractor would demolish these areas).  This little mower has a small diameter blade and is perfect for mowing on either side of pathway pavers and small grassy patches.  The mower was pretty much assembled in the box - all you have to do is attach the grass catcher, bolt on the arms, and charge the batteries.  Easy!  The only reason I didn't give the mower 5 stars was due to battery life.  I fully charged both batteries prior to use.  The first battery died after about 200 sq ft of usage and the 2d battery died after about 300 ft of usage.  I am currently recharging both batteries and will update this review if battery life improves.  Nonetheless, the area I needed to clean up is done for another week and took me little time to whip into shape with this machine.  I will probably buy one more battery and another charger should battery life not improve on this 2d charging round."

        "text": "First of all, understand that I think I'm the perfect person for this mower. Our front and back lawns are small. We are in a very suburban area so we have no field of weeds to deal with and our grass is the thin bladed stuff. If you had a big lawn and had to deal with a lot of weeds I'm not so sure this more would be so smart for you. You have to understand that battery-powered mowers are not nearly as powerful as corded electric or gas mowers. If you understand that and don't need that power than a mower like this is perfect. I love that it's much quieter and I'm never having to worry about gas or that darned cord getting in the way (I've had both). This thing is light! It's so easy to push that it makes me wonder how durable this is going to be in the long run. It almost feels like you're pushing a toy. The battery does not last as long as I was expecting. I have two small lawns (font and back) and I am able to get two sessions out of one battery. I would have expected three or four. If you were using this in the weeds you would have a struggle as the power you'd need just wouldn't be there. It has some good safety measure built into it like a key and a startup procedure that a small kid would struggle with. I have serious doubts about how long the rear collection basket is going to last as it seems like it's designed to fail sooner than later. The collection is super-cheap feeling and I have a feeling that no matter how careful I am with it I'll be buying an overpriced replacement in less than two years. I think that a part that is going to go on and off constantly deserves much more attention and reinforcement than this cheap bag. So keep that in mind before you buy it because I guarantee you that it will not last longer than a couple years."

        "text": "This is less noisy than the old electric mower. The people inside the house thought it was the next door neighbors mowing instead of right outside on their own lawn. The little pull bar is comfortable to hold against the handle and doesn't leave one with blisters.The mower did strain quite a bit when working through a weedy wild mustard patch. The power significantly dropped and the battery/mower have never seemed to recover fully. When working through a harder patch, the battery life does shorten considerably as more power is used up in a short amount of time. Before I used it on the mustard patch, I did the front lawn with plain grass. I made it through nearly the entire lawn on one battery only. Since the mustard patch, it takes a full charge on both of the batteries to make it through the front lawn and the battery power level seems to go up and down (can notice difference in the sound level). I'm slightly disappointed with the decline but the length of time the battery lasts has seemed to hold steady since, and the battery charges quickly in a couple hours so it's not difficult to prepare the batteries in time before a mowing day. A single battery will now last about 10-15 minutes.This is not a mulching mower, and I wouldn't really recommend using it &#34;unofficially&#34; as a mulching mower by leaving the bag off. The flap in the back is not light enough for the force of the moving air to blow the flap around to let the grass be expelled out the back. Instead, when I've tried, the grass gets matted underneath the blade. You have to have the bag on to hold the back flap up. It fills up pretty quickly, but there's a nifty tell-tale smaller flap that moves around at the top of the bag from the air movement. If it stops moving around, it's full of grass so the air can't reach the flap to move it around and it's time to empty it.Overall, the mower is easy to use and it's a blessing not to have to deal with gas or cords. It's light enough I can move it around back and forth like a vacuum cleaner (not the best mowing method, I know). As long as the battery doesn't decline further, I'm happy with it."

        "text": "This Black & Decker LST420 trimmer / edger is part of the 20V Max tool system that uses the same line of rechargeable 20 volt batteries. It is a nice cordless trimmer with 2 power settings. The trimmer can be rotated so that it performs as an edger (which allows the orange wheel at the bottom of the trimmer to be rolled along a flat surface). As an edger it seemed to be adequate, although I admit that I rarely do edging. It was really good not having to drag an extension cord all over the yard. The trimmer speed can be set at 1 (for longer battery usage) or 2 (for more power).  The \"2\" setting feels closer to my 110 volt corded weedeater, although I found that the \"1\" setting was adequate for most of the weed-eating that I was doing. The first time I used the trimmer I got about 23 minutes on one fully charged battery using the \"1\" setting about 95 percent of the time.  (My second battery was charging). About 8 or 10 minutes of that time was cutting some grass and weeds about a foot tall. It didn't get bogged down even on the \"1\" setting, which is good.  The box states in large letters, \"1 HOUR RUNTIME\" so I gave it 4 stars since I didn't believe the other battery would give me about 37 minutes.  Next time if I can get about an hour on both batteries I'll raise my rating to 5 stars.Assembly: Assembly was real easy and consisted of pushing the plastic guard into a slot (1 screw) and attaching the D shaped handle (1 bolt).Adjustments: The D shaped handle can be moved up and down the shaft, but the angle cannot be adjusted. The telescopic shaft can be shortened or lengthened. The distance between the center of the motor at the bottom of the shaft (center of the Black & Decker label on the motor) to the top of the handle can be adjusted from 36 inches to 49 inches. I'm 6 foot tall and it feels best fully extended for me.Batteries and cutting line: Two 20 volt LBXR2020 Type 4 40 Wh batteries are included. The manual indicates that it takes five hours to fully charge one battery. The following LI-ION batteries can also be used: LBX20, LBXR20, LB2X4020.  Use only 0.065 inch (1.65 mm) diameter round nylon monofilament line.  B&D; recommends the AF-100 spool:Black & Decker AF-100 String Trimmer Replacement Spool with 30 Feet of .065-Inch Line.Warranty: 2 years for home use.The LST420 works so good that my corded weedeater may just hang on the garage wall all summer long."

I don't have a lot of areas in which my grass has an opportunity to avoid my mower... but near my deck the common growth edge.  Normally I'd be concerned about gouging the wood of my cedar skirting, but the wheel that is really designed for edging,  makes a great depth guide to prevent wood gouging... I can go quite quickly across the base of the skirting at a 45 degree angle, rolling the wheel along the surface and making a perfect trim cut without a single mark...  what more can I say -- worth its weight in gold...  my trimming is fast work, looks great, and the unit has enough of a charge that even using it for 15 or 20 minutes, I don't wear the battery outThe biggest downfall to this tool is the charger...  I wish the unit had a wall charger to keep everything need, but the unit is small and just connects to the top of the battery.  Its a small price to pay for the wonderful tool, but B&D; could have done better there."

They're easy on / easy off, lightweight, and relatively quick to charge.2.  Convenient, easy-to-use adjustments. This unit is quite versatile.  With a quick squeeze, the base rotates 180 degrees and snaps into place, thus making edging a breeze.  Another quick squeeze at the base and it's back to being a 'regular' trimmer.  The height adjustment is also an excellent feature.  Lift a little lever and the unit easily adjusts for different lengths. This enables my 11-yr old daughter to adjust the unit shorter so she can get a decent angle for trimming.  She had a tough time getting a good angle using my taller corded trimmer.3.  Very lightweight overall, yet balanced and sturdy.4.  Trimmer wheel.  I've seen a few disparaging reviews about the wheel, but frankly, I think it makes trimming easier and more uniform, too. First, it's a godsend for helping my daughter make lawns look sharp in her new yard-care business (her previous work without such a guide was not pretty).  However, I love the wheel, too, as it makes edging a breeze.  I say if the wheel bothers you, be proactive and take it off!5.  I also like that the batteries work on other B & D products.  I have decided to get more B & D products that use these interchangable batteries, so there will be no more dealing with cords when I'm doing lawn care.  It will make things very convenient.What I don't like:As mentioned, it's not as powerful as my corded trimmer, but it still does the job and I'm quite happy with it.  So, if less power is my only complaint, I really have nothing to complain about.  :-)Five stars for sure.  I wish I'd bought one of these a long time ago."

I have other electric trimmers and this one is my second favorite after my 40v Greenworks.  I also have an older 18V Ni-Cad Black and Decker and this 20v Lithium kicks its' butt in terms of lightness and power.The battery is decent and is VERY light.  Lithium also allows you to have it charged and ready without worrying about the juice draining.  I could not do that with the Ni-Cad and it always annoyed me when I wanted to trim the grass with the older 18v but the battery would be dead.It is extremely light with the battery attached, and feels very well made.  If you have a smaller lawn, this will work great for you.The batteries are only interchangeable with the 20v line.  I also have a Troy Bilt gas with dual strings, but that is heavy duty and it is not fair to compare gas to electricWhen I just need to quickly whack a few weeds, I love having the electric available because pull starting gas is no fun.  Electric also requires virtually no maintenance.I would highly recommend this."

That trimmer was still working fine after seven years of use, but I was offered this one and decided to give it a shot.Wow, what a difference!  The build quality has gone up quite a bit, and remember, my old one was going strong at seven years on the original batteries.  This one has far better balance and grips, and far more power than 2 additional watts would suggest.  Previously when switching into edger mode, I'd have to make 2-3 passes to cleanly edge my lawn.  This unit took one pass to do a job that looked as good as a corded edger.My lawn isn't that big so I haven't used the &#34;Runtime Extension&#34; feature.  The automatic feed spool works as well as my old model, so no stopping to feed out more trimmer string.  I also really like that it comes with two batteries.  One is all I need for the trimmer, but I usually get the blower and edger (I have all three in 18v) and I've found the leaf blowers can go through 2 batteries easily, so I can put this extra to good use.Overall I have to give it five stars.  Between my B&D; 18v trimmer, blower, and edger and my 36v cordless mower, I've never had any problems and all my batteries still work.  Whatever they are doing, they are doing it well.  And this model just feels like it's built better than it's very reliable predecessors.  If you are in the market for a cordless trimmer, I don't see how you can go wrong with this model."

        "text": "I recently purchased a B&D; 40 volt lithium trimmer and then was offered this via the Vine program. Since we have a 2nd property, I jumped at the opportunity to try this one out. As might be expected, it isn't quite as powerful as the 40 volt version but otherwise, is very similar in function, weight and appearance. I should also add, I've been putting the 40 volt to the paces and have been impressed by what it manages to handle. My first day out, I used it to trim everything between a bunch of fruit trees in a lot that was overgrown, thick and full of weeds. It cut grass, weeds and even underbrush like a pro. Amazing!So, as I mentioned, this is not quite as powerful but assuming you aren't using it to take down swamp growth but rather an average lawn, it is more than sufficient. The charge takes about an hour (max) and seems to last 30 to 45 minutes. The string does not require a bump which is nice and last through the entire trim without worry.Weight is not problematic although it is not skimpy like some electric versions. The battery is interchangeable with other B&D; products of the same voltage (a very nice touch). The entire machine is adjustable up/down to fit short or tall persons. There is a guard on both the front and back to protect self and plants.Overall - great tool. Can't believe we waited this long to try out cordless trimmers but will NEVER go back now that we have!"

        "text": "I had been using a small electric trimmer for years.  I needed the light weight of it.  Plus, it was very cheap.  Dealing with the long and heavy extension cord while hot and tired was just too much.  I knew a gas trimmer would be way too heavy and bulky for me.Because my old trimmer was a black and decker, I was able to use the same string spools.  On one hand this was great, because I had 4 new spools.  On the other hand, I was hoping this trimmer would use thicker string.  I have chain link fence around the majority of my yard, and I would normally go through 3 spools of string each time I used the electric trimmer.  I assumed it would be the same with this Black and Decker LST420 trimmer.  Not the case.  I don't understand it.  Maybe it's because it rotates faster and is more efficient.  I don't know.  Whatever the reason, I am extremely happy about it.For my purposes, I am not a fan of the edging/wheel.  A lot of my sidewalk areas are higher than the yard level.  I found in these areas, the edger didn't work well.  On part of my driveway where they are the same level, it worked fine.  I also had trouble getting close to an area at the base of my porch, because the wheel seemed to hinder the reach of the string.I am very happy with this trimmer, and it is such a relief not to drag around that cumbersome mega-long extension cord (about 100' cord)."

And I have to say everything about this trimmer is an improvement.The 20v battery is stronger but half the size and weight of the 18v battery. It charges faster and holds its charge longer between use. And it comes with two batteries! One to use and one to charge.  All rechargeable tools should come with two batteries!It also has a power slide that allows you to control how much power it is using. If you are just trimming grass, set it at 1 and the charge will last much longer. But if you have some big weeds, slide it up to 6 for more power.The trimmer line is automatic feed and you can buy replacement spools that just click on if you don't like winding your line.And I will admit the wheel on the front of the head does look silly, but it works. After you swivel the head around, you roll the wheel down the edge of your sidewalk and it becomes a very good edger, the wheel keeps it at a consistent depth.Overall a definite improvement over the old trimmer and I can't wait to get more of these 20v tools."

        "text": "An adjustable lightweight trimmer that works very well, but struggles with heavy weeds. The 20V Li-ion batteries have plenty of power, and just one (of 2 provided) is plenty to trim my entire 1/3-acre property, including edging driveway and walks. The adjustable length, movable handle, and light weight make it easy for either the GF or I to use the trimmer. Assembly is easy and the unit feels well-made.Trimming works well with the handle adjusted to the correct length. The unit has two power modes, and the low-power mode is sufficient for grass, cleaning up around walls and corners, and the like. I use the high-power mode for edging and weeds. Edging works surprisingly well, with the reversible head and a wheel for maintaining constant height. The height of the wheel is just right so the string cuts into the dirt a little, making a neat edge-- nice enough that I no longer feel a need to pull out myB&D; LE750 Edge Hogfor anything other than edging around tree beds. The wheel also takes the unit's weight during edging, reducing strain on my arms.Heavy, fibrous vine-like weeds are hard for this unit, the longer pieces end up not being cut all the way through, and wrap around the spinning part of the edger (which causes it to stop). If you're bush-whacking, you'll need a heavier-duty unit.But my only real complaint is hand-fatigue. I wish B&D; would come up with an easier safety mechanism than a trigger that has to be held constantly (at least a lower-tension trigger). My trigger-hand gets pretty tired after using the trimmer for a while, although the unit is not hand-specific (so I end up switching hands periodically). A minor complaint is the wheel makes it hard to get the trimmer right up to a wall.Two years ago, I had opted for the Ni-Cad poweredBlack & Decker NST2118because the B&D; Li-ion trimmer at the time was half-again as expensive. The lithium-powered models have since come down in price. Comparing this LST420 to the older NST2118, the LST420:* Has a more powerful 20V Li-ion battery (vs NST2118's 18V Ni-Cad)* Li-ion battery weighs much less, 13oz vs NST2118's 31oz* One Li-ion battery does my whole yard w/ power left over (the 2 NiCads struggled to do the same yard)* The edger wheel works much better than the NST2118's extending edger \"bracket\" (which dragged on rough surfaces, and collapsed back into the unit when pressed against the ground)* The handle slides up and down the shaft to adjust (rather than tilting from a fixed location)* Quieter than the NST2118 (especially in low-power mode)I was an early adopter of rechargeable lawn equipment; this LST420 replaced my Ni-Cad NST2118, which had replaced my ancient CST2000 (circa mid-late 90s with 12V Lead-Acid battery). For household use, rechargeable lawn equipment is a definite win: low-maintenance, much quieter than gas, no emissions, no handling toxic fluids, and a lighter environmental footprint when the batteries are maintained and recycled properly.Seriously, this thing is nearly silent compared to commercial gas-powered units. Also note the battery warnings; it can take up to 10 hours to charge up a completely discharged battery, and B&D; advises not storing the battery discharged (eg, during winter).For household and other light duty, look no further than this great little trimmer. Those looking for heavier use might be better off with Black & Decker's 36V or 40V versions. Commercial-duty users should stick to gas. For my use, this trimmer is perfect, and Highly Recommended."

Even without instructions, which there are some very light instructions, the assembly was a piece of cake. The batteries work great, and don't make it that much heavier than my electrical one. I would take cordless over the hassle of the cord anyway. Really my only complaint is my electrical one came with two spools of wire, this only came with one. On the other hand, it did come with two batteries which is certainly a better bargain.

Just add the app to your phone, and it goes right with you.While we have used many variations of meat thermometers and alarms, this one is unique because in addition to having two probes which can be set separately, it also will connect with an app on your newer Bluetooth devices to monitor your food away from the kitchenI received a free sample to test for my review, so I put it through a few extra tests in order to write my review.I used boiling water to test the probe temperature along with my digital probe. Both probes on the thermometer measured within one degree of my own probe and one another.While these weren't slow by any means, they were slower in registering temperature than the digital probe that I use.After downloading the software, I was able to monitor the temperature in the living room on my iPhone.Overall, I was very impressed. I have chosen four stars (instead of five) because I found some of the instructions and documentation difficult to understand.

        "text": "If you browse through my reviewer profile you will see that I have reviewed many different BBQ accessories over the years.  I love gadgets and I love to grill.  I've used a number of different wireless thermometers and rarely grill without one anymore.This one is innovative compared to the others that I've used, because it uses a Bluetooth (BT) connection to connect to the CAPPEC app on my iPhone.  (Search for \"CAPPEC\" in the iTunes store.)  Since the iPhone has way more capabilities than a simple LED readout on a monitor, there are a lot more features available through the app.  Awesome!  For example, if you're a data junkie like me, you'll love the ability to watch a graph of the temps of your meat.So what do you get with this thermometer?*  A small black box that kind of reminds me of an AppleTV unit, only smaller.*  Two meat probes.*  A little screwdriver that you'll need to get access to the batterycover.  (I wish I had found this before I struggled to get intothe battery hatch.  It's a lot easier with this little jeweler'sscrewdriver.)Download the app from the app store (iTunes or Android...ooh, I wonder if I can side-load this onto my Kindle Fire tablet?) and launch the app.  Don't do like I did and try to pair the receiver in the BT settings, because that's now how this device works.  Just make sure BT is turned on on your phone.  The app recognized my receiver right away.Here's a quick note about Bluetooth technology.  I don't recall the precise limits of the BT standards, but in my experience most BT devices have a range of less than 25'.  This one had a comparable range where the signal was good up to about 20'-25'.  That's fine with me, but it means I need to leave my iPhone outside near the grill.  Otherwise I'll have to reacquire the signal when I go back outside.  This is important to understand though:  This thermometer is wireless, but it's not what I'd call \"remote\".  Although you're not exactly tethered to the probes, you can't go inside to powder your nose and expect to keep the signal going.Now about the app...I work for a major entertainment company and a big part of our business is mobile apps.  Because of my job I'm probably a tougher critic of mobile apps than most people.  And although I have a couple of small gripes with this app, overall I'm very very happy with it.  And the genius of creating an app to connect to this thermometer is that the manufacturer can release enhancements and bug fixes in the future.  That's fantastic, because I've used some remote thermometers that were pretty good but had flaws that could never be fixed.  I'm happy to know that this one will be upgraded over time.So the device itself is pretty rugged and durable.  The probes are very substantial and I expect them to last a long time.  Frankly I doubt I'll use both probes simultaneously very often, just because I typically only cook one type of meat at a time.  On the other hand, I've been burned before (bad pun) by inaccurate sampling when I put the probe in the wrong spot.  It's nice to have two probes and be able to poke the meat in more than one location.Overall I'm very happy with this thermometer.  It's actually strong competition for my previous favorite.  The only reason I can think of to use my former favorite thermometer is if I need to leave the area and need a remote unit.  But I actually prefer to hang out by the grill, so that's probably not going to be an issue.Well done, CAPPEC.I was provided this item for review."

The signal went no further than my very small kitchen. When trying it outdoors the signal was lost at the end of a thirty foot walkway, but our garage may have blocked the signal.Now beyond that, it was easy to install the three AAA batteries with the help of the little screwdriver provided. It was also a snap to download the free application. The App itself is a blast, full of extras beyond just keeping you informed of the temperature. The App also keeps a journal of your last 10 BBQs, keeps a temperature graph of what you are cooking, and has a separate page that keeps track of internal temperature and estimated cook time, although I thought it was showing a very short cook time for me, it actually wasn't all that far off in accuracy. However since I  go by temperature I didn't really  pay close attention to that feature. It accommodates 2 probes for those times when you have more meat to BBQ. I like that it comes preprogrammed with many different varieties of meats and the suggested temperatures for cooking them , both gourmet and USDA. If you want, you are able to customize your temperature setting as well.It was pretty cool later on in the evening being able to go back on the App and check out how the smoking temperature progressed over the course of the day.Can't wait to try this on a big Turkey or roast beef, when it cools down enough to have the oven on for hours again. I am hoping that when using it entirely in the house that the Bluetooth will work correctly."

The other thermometer I tested had as many features, but was so complicated to use that I almost gave up.Another feature that all of these thermometers share is accuracy. The probes are heavy duty and even the display and control unit is built to withstand the elements.There a few things you need to know because the instruction sheet is scant at best. To be fair, the information is in the sheet, but for some reason is easy to overlook. First, the real instructions are in a tab in the downloadable app. Second, when you go into bluetooth discovery mode you can pair this device to your phone or tablet, but it will not connect. The app does that for you.One other thing that you need to know is this has the same limitations as any bluetooth device. If you wander more than ten meters or there are obstructions between you and the unit you can drop the signal. That is not a flaw in this thermometer - it's part of the bluetooth specification. I tested the unit for distance and mine actually held for about twelve meters, so there is a little wiggle-room built in.I tested this with both a Galaxy Note 3 phone and a Tab 3 10.1 tablet. Both worked perfectly.Other things I love about this include the ability to use set temperatures for either gourmet or USDA for various meats and doneness, or set your own. And the ease of cleaning the probes after each use.Overall I am thrilled with this set. I know that borders on hyperbole, but that is truly how I feel. If you barbeque or grill outside and own a smartphone I strongly recommend this thermometer set."

We can pick between gourmet temps or USDA recommended temps.I can also use my own temp settings (140 to 399 F), and there are four timer settings for each probe.  What for?  Adding marinade or turning the meat.  So very useful.For the pork roast last night, the device sounded several minutes before my app got word of it, but that's all right.Some improvements I would like to see include a container or bag to keep all the equipment together.  Also, the probes can go in the oven, but the display must hang outside.

The grill plates are easy to clean with a wire brush, I use one of those 3 sided Weber brushes, and love it.If the grill won't move far, or you have a paved driveway, or deck this is a great unit.  If you have to move it over gravel or grass, you may want something with bigger wheels."

        "text": "I have to give props to the designers at FUEGO, the element manages to be incredibly functional while maintaining a very small footprint. It is a breeze to move around and there is plenty of room on the outside cooking zone (the grill has two zones with differing heat characteristics). I grilled 8 burgers and 6 bratwurst simultaneously using both zones. Assembly was quick and painless (&#60; 30min) thanks to very well thought out packaging. It felt like opening an iPhone; there was nearly no wasted space and you only had to unpack parts as they were needed. My only qualm with the assembly was that the quick instructions didn't account for a couple of included parts. They were however referenced in the manual, although in the parts list one part was called the ignition stick but in the instructions it was referred to as the lighting stick (just kind of weird considering how much attention to detail everything else was given). One thing to note is that in order to get the grill to temperature you MUST have the cover on. Even with the cover on, cooking took a bit longer than I was used to. Overall this is a sexy, sturdy, functional grill."

        "text": "We really like the design of this grill. Its got a sleek and futurist design that not only gives it a cool and hip look but is a great space saver as well. We normally keep our grill in an enclosed screened-in porch and roll it out onto the patio when in use. This keeps the grill out of the weather and hopefully helps preserve the life of it. We've had one of those grills that you've probably seen at the local hardware store. The big double grill with gas on one side and charcoal on the other. We even got the extra smoker that is added on the end of that. That thing is huge and heavy to roll around. Enter the  Fuego Element Gas Grill! Oh what a difference! We didn't need that big ole' huge thing that we've been using. I wouldn't grill at times when I really wanted to just because I didn't want to mess with getting that behemoth out.The biggest feature that we like about the Fuego is of course, the design. It's upright so it takes up little space. The grill tank even fits inside the stand. It takes less space up that way and it just looks better. Its design makes it easy and lightweight for us to roll out of the screened-in porch and onto the patio.The grill itself has a double ring of gas so that you can cook with both on or just one. I like that feature so you can get the grill super hot for steaks and burgers or cook in a more indirect heat for items that need to be on the grill longer.This grill is more like a kettle grill in that the lid comes completely off. The handles are made where you can hang the lid onto the handles when the lid is not on the grill. With this design, you don't have a warming rack. We actually like that because we usually take the warming racks off. The racks are just in our way and eventually get rust onto our food below if we don't remove them. Just keep that mind if you are use to using a warming rack or really like a hinged lid. We had a kettle grill moons ago and I actually always quite liked it so these things are not an issue with me.The grill itself seems to be well built and I hope it lasts a quite awhile. We have only been getting a couple years out of the last couple grills that we've had even though we keep ours under a porch."

        "text": "Having recently junked another brand of round grill that either flared up or flickered out too many times, I very much appreciate the design of the Fuego Element.  The ring-within-ring design lets the cook put roasts and whole chickens in the center of the grill, and using only the outside ring, create the indirect cooking available on grills that take up more space. For the hamburger and steak crowd, use both burners, turning down the flame level after the grill heats up.  The grill has plenty of area to cook a meal for a group of six people.The grill arrived in excellent condition, thanks to lots of cardboard and some ingenious packaging.  The dizzying array of parts to assemble made sense thanks to charts on the outside of the carton (partially obscured by UPS \"caution\" tape) and in the instruction booklet.  Took about 45 minutes to unpack and assemble.  VERY good looking.There are a couple of convenience features that are on a Weber grill that we purchased at Christmas as a gift.  One is a warming rack farther from the flame than the cooking area, and the other is a scale that weighs the propane tank to tell the owner approximately how much gas is left in the tank.  But for family meals and casual entertaining, this grill is terrific."

Sleek, smooth black steel, roll easily on 4 wheels and small foot print. You can probably recall that was what used to describe the Apple computer!The gas tank is hidden inside the stand. All operations are precise, everything fit together impressively well. It took a bit more than 5 minutes to get up to 450 deg F not like the description said, but it is no matter. I had to adjust the flame down because it got too hot. I can't believe I would say that about a gas grill. Its maximum temperatures' rival that of a charcoal grill. While I still keep my favorite charcoal Weber, I have been using this grill mostly since I got it. I need that hight temperature for steaks, and this grill delivered effortlessly.Cooking with this grill is a real joy. You will love it."

        "text": "I had the chance to try this grill out, and having bought a number of grills in the past trying to find the right one I took the opportunity to check this one out. Overall, if I were to give it a buy, try or don't buy my rating on this would be a try and here is why.The grill itself is not the cheap. It's approx $300 at the time of this review and for that same price you could hit your big box hardware store and get a number of grills with larger cooking area, heavier quality lid to retain heat and may even have it assembled. Now what you won't get is a really neat looking grill. I mean this thing is sleek. I love the look of the grill and the functionality of how they hide the propane tank under it with a door on a hinge instead of just an exposed back like most grills use.I like the fact that the handles on the side of this grill are designed for multi use, you can for instance hang your cooking utensils on them. You can use them to wheel the grill around or you can even slide the lid to the grill on either side into the handle to create a small wind screen.This is the first grill I have seen with a function like this.So if it looks great, and has nice looking features what is wrong with it?Overall the grill is made out of quality materials from what I can tell. The door that holds the propane take is decent thickness, the handles are firm and don't flex when pulled. But here's the 2 main problems I have.The grill comes with cheap, very cheap plastic wheels. They work ok but I found that just wheeling the grill around the garage the wheels started to scuff pretty bad. As soon as I ran over anything it actually caused small dents in the wheel. The quality of them is just horrendous, I think they should have splurged and given an upgrade to the wheels to make them stronger and more durable. Other grills I have owned have had stronger, harder plastic wheels.The other issue is the quality of the lid. The lid is a HUGE piece of any grill. It's what holds the heat in and if it's thick you can retain a lot more heat making your propane be more efficient. It also does NOT have any type of hinge on it. You pick the lid up and have to put it somewhere out of your way. The grill does feature lid slits in the handles but that really isn't that easy to use when you are quickly trying to get the lid off to flip your food. Yes it works, but on more than one occasion the lid actually fell out of the mount when I was trying to use it. Nothing like a hot lid falling near your feet. Then there is the lid quality. The lid on every grill I have owned has been thick, you can't flex or bend it. This grill however the lid feels extremely cheap. In fact mine was bent when I unboxed it, Not a problem because it was so thin I could actually easily bend it back into shape. This lid should be much higher quality, it should not bend at all. Plus if you look at most grills the handle to the lid is on the front and it rotates upwards for a reason, lots of heat could burn you. Weber grills feature a lid similar to this one where you lift straight up but the difference is they have air vents you can open and shut to control heat. On this grill there are slits cut into the lid so if you are cooking you really should be wearing gloves when putting the lid on or off of this grill (especially off) so that you don't burn yourself.It's a neat design and that is really what you are buying here. Yes it functions, but there are so many things I don't like about this grill. If they would improve the quality of the wheels I'd probably bump this up to 4 stars. If they had a better quality lid with vents you could open/close it would get 5 stars. But at this price point to me there are several other options you could go with.I will add, the grill does assemble easily, took me around 30 minutes. It does heat up quickly and it does function."

        "text": "We've had Weber grills for a lifetime it seems. So I'm used to the standard grill that comes from the big box stores. After assembling and using it for awhile, there are some great strengths and a couple of weaknesses.Assembly was pretty easy although it was a little difficult getting one of the base parts to line up. A little strong arming and it sat in place long enough for me to get the screws in. In the end, there were some chains that were supposed to have something to do with the ignition and another one for the lid but no only did I not have an extra screw to attach it (as was implied in the directions) but I still couldn't see a purpose in them. The directions were sadly lacking here.The appearance is really neat. I really like the accessibility of the tank using the hinged front door panel. This allows us to turn the gas off at the tank for every use. Our Weber has the tank in the back with a grill front that makes it almost impossible to reach the tank knob. The lid and the circular grill base do not line up completely. I'm assuming this is because they are a thinner metal and it is pretty easy to make a domed shape slightly off. But I can keep the lid on without any problems, it is just a little off in alignment. The actual grill is supposed to have a marking on it to show which side faces down but I searched and searched and found no marking so I went with instinct on placement.It is pretty easy to move around but the wheels are mediocre and I didn't realize until after I put them on that there are two that specifically belong on the back and I had them mixed up. And that was a mistake on my part, they were indicated in the directions once I went back and read it again. I guess I was just assuming that wheels were wheels and they all looked the same at first glance.I had no trouble with ignition although it helps if I blow slightly at the gas towards the ignition. There are two burners (you can use one or both). It heats up quickly according to the temperature gauge on the lid. Mine definitely got to well over 500 and I think was 600 one time.What I really liked was how evenly it cooked our meat. We've cooked London broil, pork tenderloin and hamburgers. All seem to be a little more moist and nicely cooked. You can get a char on the outside but even though it is really hot, it seems to do more of a bake to the inside. I really liked how our food turned out and it was enough of a difference to notice.So I like how it cooks. I like the large grease pan although there is nothing disposable about it, it needs to be wiped/washed out. It does collect rain water but so does my Weber, even with a cover on - not sure how though.I like the look of this and the ease of use. I'm sure I will need even more time to make this work even more to my benefit. I am by no means a grill expert so a little experimentation and maybe I can learn a few more tricks."

The temperature gauge is very accurate, according to my external gauge I use to double-check. (5 minutes is the max time I saw to hit max temperatures for searing.)The meat is seared quickly and perfectly!  No unevenness, even with large cuts of meat.The meat is cooked to perfection--every cut we tried came out exactly as we'd hoped.  I swear, we were on the brink of &#34;trying&#34; to get it to do something &#34;wrong&#34;, but it never did...we tried cheap steaks, expensive steaks, roasts, chicken pieces, whole chickens, various fish, and veggies.  It is awesome!  We have a really nice patio grill (not naming names, but it's a huge stainless one from Costco) and we have not used it ONCE since this arrived, except for comparison purposes.  This one has beat it out as far as quality of cooking, speed of cooking, ease of use, and looks.  Sorry, (insert Costco's fancy BBQ name here).The ONE con I could find is that the pizza stone is so expensive. I REALLY wanted to try it, as one of the big things I have always dreamed of doing is to make outdoor pizzas...maybe sometime down the line, I can afford it...but for now, that review will have to wait.It's beautiful, easy to move, easy to store, and above all else--is accurate (the thermometer works!) and a quality cooking tool."

        "text": "[n.b.: See the revised comments at the end of this review]First off, this is a really strikingly attractive grill; you can't help but be impressed with the clean, modern, Euro-style look. It's almost futuristic. Call it the iGrill. Under the skin, though, it has a few issues.Assembly: This is pretty straightforward. It'll take about a half hour of your time, and a few extra items: A box or utility knife, a large Phillips screwdriver, a 16mm end wrench (although an adjustable or even a 11/16ths will do as well), and a single quality AA battery. The instructions state that no battery is included, but mine had three- a cheap Chinese AA cell- which went right into the recycling bin- and a pair of \"Kirkland\" brand batteries that followed it there. There is also a stamped steel 16/14mm wrench included, but trying to use it to attach the casters is an exercise in frustration. Use a thicker wrench. You'll thank me.The first step is to unpack the parts, and the makers have thoughtfully printed the unpacking and assembly instructions on the outside of the box (although you'll find a little booklet inside as well.) Slice the box along the dotted line with your box knife and lift off. You can now remove the individual boxes inside, which slide together like parts of a wooden puzzle. Very clever. The first actual assembly step is to attach the wheels, using the 16mm wrench. Next, the metal grill attached to the base with M5 screws, and the tank hanger attaches to the grill with supplied M6 screws. Simple. Attach the \"spine\", a piece of rectangular tubing that stiffens the assembly, insert the AA battery and the control valve knob, invert the whole assembly, and you're almost done. The instructions warn you to DO NOT USE THE HANDLE TO LIFT THE ASSEMBLY which is kind of odd, as there aren't a lot of ways to lift this other than the handles. And if you can't use the handles for lifting, how it it that you can use them for moving the cart? I grabbed the unit by the base and the grill and slowly eased it over.The door snaps into place easily, and is held shut by a pair of magnetic latches. Nice. Slide the good sized \"residue tray\" (drip pan) in, and the flame diffuser drops on to the top of the grill- or rather, it should drop on to the top of the grill, but it turned out that the sheet metal that forms the the lower part of the flying saucer you see in the photo was bent. One side looks like it took a substantial impact, or perhaps was dropped on its side before being packed. If I'd purchased this rather than having received a review item I'd have called the company at that point and requested a replacement part. Instead, I got out a rubber mallet and a chunk of 2x4 and reshaped the bowl so I could finish the assembly and review.Having done a bit of body work the diffuser now fit into the bowl, and that left only the task of placing the grill on top of the diffuser, rolling it across my driveway a safe distance from my house, and installing an LP gas tank.  I got some root vegetables form the house (carrot, onion, potato) for my first test and fired up the grill. It took only a minute to reach 200F, another minute and a half to reach 300F, and a total of five minutes to reach 400. 500 F took ten minutes, 550 took 15, and it never got any hotter than that.I tested both the single burner mode (outside ring) and the double burner mode, and looking at the flames from the vent slots under the burners, I noticed something odd: While the interior burner ring produced a series of perfect little lovely blue flames over the holes in the burner, indicating complete combustion, the outer ring produced an orange flame that was detached from the burner and moved around a lot. That suggested poor air flow, or possible too large a jet in that burner. I tried this with the lid on and off, and got the same results in both cases. There was a light wind, but I wouldn't think that should be a problem with a well designed grill.  The poor combustion may be what my grill didn't heat up as fast as the specs suggest it should; I may have to do some disassembly and checking to see if perhaps a jet is missing, or improperly installed. [Update: I tested it again on a wind-free day, and the flame was stable and blue. But the slightest breeze disrupts this.]Cooking burgers with both burners set on high, I was surprised to discover that there wasn't as much heat coming out of the grill as I expected. I could hold my hand comfortable over the burner for several seconds with no discomfort. But if I placed the lid on, the temperature reached 500F quickly. It seems that the grill really needs to have the lid on for good efficiency.Another detail that concerned me had to do with the wheels- they're plastic, and just rolling the grill over 15 feet of concrete resulted in scratches and dents. These are not the sort of caster wheels one should put on outdoor equipment. If you get one, I strongly suggest heading to your local home store and getting some hard rubber casters to replace them.So while this is an attractive, and generally well made grill, it does have a few issues that need to be addressed before i can really recommend it. Over the next few weeks I'm going to do some comparison cooking tests with my Weber Q 320, which has given me great service for the past several years. If I make any more discoveries I'll update this review.Footnote: Fuego doesn't appear to offer a cover for this grill to protect it from the elements, or at any rate, Amazon doesn't offer a cover from Fuego.  You can buy some loose fitting covers from third-party suppliers, but I found a very inexpensive yet hard-wearing  all weather cover: A heavy-duty contractor  type garbage bag. Thanks to the cylindrical design a large garbage bag slips right over the grill. Mine stated on even through the 30mph+ wind thunderstorm we experienced a few days ago. Just remember to let the grill cool before you cover it!(Postscript: The maker, believing that my unit may have been damaged,  has offered to send me a replacement unit. When that one arrives I'll evaluate it and update this review.)Followup: The replacement unit arrived two days ago and assembly went much faster this time, as I was familiar with the process. Unpacking it, though, I noticed that this one had a dent in the rim of the bowl, too (see photos). It wasn't as bad as the first unit, and I could assemble it without bending it back into shape, so I left it alone for my tests. I also noticed that there was a big misalignment where the gas jet entered the outer burner tube (see photos), even more so than on the first unit. I finished the assembly, attached an LP gas tank, and began my tests, starting with time to temperature.As the grill heated up I noticed that the thermometer wasn't moving- and then it abruptly jumped 25 or more degrees. Close inspection revealed that the needle on the temperature gauge was misaligned, and was rubbing against the face of the gauge. As this would make accurate measurements impossible, I turned off the grill and let it cool. I then swapped lids with grill #1, and started it up again. This time I got the following times:200 F - 45 sec300 F - 1:30400 F  - 2:50500 F - 5:00550 F - 5:45This was much faster than the times I obtained with the first grill. Heat seemed more even, too, even though the outer burner showed a lot of yellow.I like this grill a lot, for a number of reasons. The design is superb. Ease of use is first rate. Efficiency- also excellent. But I'm still concerned about the quality control. Mine had three problems that never should have gotten past quality control: The bent dish, the thermometer needle, and the misaligned burner tube. None interfere a lot with use, but they indicate a lack of attention to QC, and that suggests there may be other hidden problems. It may also be that I just happened to get two problem units from a bad production run. On the other hand, the company was very responsive about addressing the problems I reported. So my advice would be if you like the looks of this grill, go ahead and order it, but give it a very careful inspection when it arrives, and if there are problems, let Amazon and the maker know. They'll take care of it."

But I have also become increasingly disabled so have been trying some more compact grills. I ordered this since like so many have stated, it LOOKS very APPLE like.Looks verses performance....Being so disabled I had 2 neighbors assemble it for me and as a reward, be the first to cook on it with MY food. The box is in itself like a little puzzle you follow to assemble the grill. It's really funny watching neighbors argue about assembly when drinking a few beers with such an odd cut along the dotted lines layout:-)It took maybe 30 minutes of actual assembly time using MY tools. Add another 15 minutes for USMC opinion sharing that wasn't needed but free entertainment for me anyway. On a side note, I wish Vendors would allow me to choose WHO delivers my parcels....Especially given what my driver has told me about the FUN they have seeing who can toss what the HARDEST off of walls etc......Given the ripped, torn, slashed parcels I have received from UPS I have NO respect for them and would elect to even pay a premium for FEDEX or USPS. Luckily, the contents here were &#8220;OK&#8221; and all worked fine.We had very quick and EVEN cooking/heat. We only elected to cook 6 hamburgers since Marines I know anyway are happy as can be with just good old beer & burgers. Meat was juicy as any other grill I have owned as long as I do NOT flip them constantly. I cook 4 minute on Medium, flip for another 3-4 minutes and EAT the suckers.I LOVE the look and functional design. I am still getting used to using the lid design but I am so disabled I have odd problems with even the most simple things. I like the locking wheels though I can't imagine my wheelchair going fast enough with a lap full food to add to the grill that I could really have much NEED for them?To be honest, it is simply the BEAUTY of this that attracts me to it so much. I give it 4 stars and if nothing fails or no weak links appear, I will raise it to 5 stars. I will also have to buy another LPG cylinder if I keep using this over my other since I am unable to swap out my single tank between my grills and this does NOT come with one of it's own....No big deal, just be aware you do NOT get one included.. The one negative for me and it is sort of a BIG one since I am so disabled is this has no fold up/down side trays of any type. This is one of those things where it is simply built to show off it's looks and for me anyway, a very much needed item is left out to help keep it beautiful. Still, I NEED that so have to use a patio table next to it for this purpose instead."

        "text": "FUEGO FELG21C Element Gas Grill Carbon SteelThis grill is smaller in size but has some nice features.  Assembly was reasonably straight forward.  The included wrench like all included wrenches is worthless but it was a nice gesture.  Assembly was pretty straight forward.  The instructions were adequate, not great but not particularly bad.  Assembly was pretty straight forward.  The size is substantially smaller than my previous grills but then so is the number of folks for whom I grill.The size is appropriate for practically everything but a large party.  The quality seems very substantial and a very reasonable price.  The grill top is very solid and appears to be the one that needs seasoned.  They do not make it clear which one of the two grill tops they seem to have for the same grill. One needs seasoned and the other does not.  Size wise this would be a great grill for an apartment or small area.  There is no tray or table attached which is one of the reasons it is so diminutive.  The burner set up as a higher intensity burner in the center and lower on the outside.  The center burner seems to incorporate the outside burner while the outside burner seems to allow the inside burner to remain unused providing a more indirect and slower cooking.The electronic ignition does not work.  I tried three different batteries and it never generated a spark.  The instructions state to put the side of the grill down that is marked face down.  I found nothing anywhere that said \"face down\".  There was a bag of screws that were very similar in appearance and are not the same.  Two bags of clearly marked screws would be better.  Overall, ignoring the minor issues, it is a nice grill that seems like it should be reasonably durable."

        "text": "The title for this item is a bit misleading. (18&#34; Basting Mop With 2 Replacement Heads). As the continued description states, it comes with TWO detachable machine washable heads...1 head attached and 1 replacement head, 2 heads total as shown in the picture.Up until now I have been contending with nylon bristled, and silicon bristled basting brushes. While they have their good uses in the kitchen for small jobs, they fall far short with many jobs on the grill. You simply can not quickly apply large quantities of sauce/marinade with those types. Also, most have very short handles which forces your hands down too close to the heat and that takes away from the fun of grilling.This is the perfect grilling companion for quickly slopping your sauces onto your meats. It provides quick and easy coverage with a long and sturdy handle so you can get the job done fast and get back to your beer, your lady friend, or whatever. I can not recommend this basting mop enough for anyone who does a lot of BBQ such as racks of ribs. You can really slop a lot of sauce on quickly.The heads screw onto the handle securely so they will not be coming loose in the middle of the job. For cleanup, I removed the head and only hand-washed the handle. I hand-washed the head under running water with a bit of dish soap to get the majority of the sauce out and then I tossed it into the dishwasher along with my dishes to get it looking as clean as new again. I allow it to air dry well before storing it away with the handle. I anticipate the handle and the heads holding up very well.I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I hope you love this basting mop as much as I do."

I just wish the handle was about 2&#34; longer, but no biggie. Cleanup was easy, there are several ways you could clean the head, but I just washed it under water with a small amount of soap and let it air dry. Since it comes with an extra head I figure I'm in good shape for a long time with this one."

The mop head was fantastic sopping up the marinade; however, I did experience a little difficulty in basting the meat; it seemed to gather up the sauce but not want to put it on the meat. Having said this, I still think it is fantastic. I was worried about the clean up but was pleasantly surprised that the mop head cleaned extremely well and dried in a small amount of time. This will be my go-to basting utensil for all my grilling. What a clever idea. I would definitely recommend the purchase and it is reasonable priced and should last a very long time."

When it arrived, I was a little leery of the lack of care/clean up instructions on the packaging.  However I rinsed it under running water then just put the screw off mop head in the dishwasher. It came out perfectly clean, without loosing the first string. (Flash back to many a bad string mop experience!)This mop does come with two heads that very easily screw on and off for replacement. That is great for various reasons, the main being the ability to baste meat and vegetables with a different brush. It  provides great coverage on the meat . We used it on ribs and it couldn't have performed better.  We then swapped the head to baste the zucchini with an olive oil herb mix. It was superb for both uses. The handle is of a length that keeps your hands away from the heat.The only suggestion I could offer is to add those clean up instructions to the packaging. Just to take the guess work out of it."

It is large enough to help the user from getting to close to the coals or flame on even a large barbecue grill. We grill several times a week in our household, so finding a spatula that not only does its job well, but washes up easily and is manufactured in a way that you know it will be ok to become attached to it as it will be around for many years to come with its sturdy construction, is good. Added bonus is that it has a bottle opener fit right into it. While I at first thought, well, that would be awkward to use when the spatula is all dirty and greasy from use (and I imagine it would be) but when it is clean and hanging from the grill on it's leather cord and you are lounging out in the yard, it can be a handy item to know is there and not have to grab a bottle opener for those times you are not grilling and just enjoying the outdoors nearby.

These tongs are well made from heavy gauge stainless steel with nice-looking oak wood accents for a good grip. Also, the handles are long enough that even my wife doesn't mind taking over grilling duties because hands don't get too close to the heat when using them. These tongs were obviously designed by people who actually grill. In the past, I have kept two different tongs on hand to use depending on the size and weight of whatever I'm grilling, because typically, some tongs are good only for picking up small/light items quickly without losing grip while other tongs are cumbersome to use for picking up small stuff but excel at picking up large heavy steaks and ribs without losing grip on the meat. These tongs do a wonderful job at both. They have precision for small stuff and sturdy enough for the heavy stuff and they grip everything securely so your food makes it to the table without having to invoke the 5 second rule. I detest any tongs that won't lock into the closed position for compact storage and these lock shut easily and securely in addition to having a handy hook hanger so I can hang them on one of my grill hooks for quick access while I'm grilling. I own several grilling utensils from Mr. Grill's product line and I highly recommend all of them for the avid griller. They are very well made by people who understand grilling needs, what features work well and what doesn't, and they are built to last."

Nice locking feature, just slides in and out. My other tongs had an extra piece that had to slide over the handle. Clean up is easy and they can hang from a hook so they are handy while grilling.

Any animal, target species or not, will die a slow and terrible death, will break about every bone in its body trying to free itself from this medieval torture device, and either die of dehydration or blood loss due to self-inflicted amputation attempts.Why any decent human being would ever want to torture an animal like this is beyond me.  Owls have gotten so hopelessly stuck on these terrible traps when they tried to grab what looked like an easy meal that they had to be euthanized.  We are working hard to get these types of traps banned from US markets for good.  Pets have gotten stuck on those things, and if you have ever tried to get this thing off a cat's face and witnessed its agony and terror you might get a glimpse at what you are doing to animals if you decide to use such a trap.There are much more humane methods out there to eliminate a mouse problem, this is most definitely, without any question, the absolutely worst one you can choose.

        "text": "We live in an almost 100 year old farm house that is apparently, advertised in \"Mouse Daily\" as THEE place to move into during Spring and Fall. Short of tearing our home down, there is simply NO WAY to find all the cracks and crevices that these critters climb through, to gain entry into our home. When you go to grab your frying pan and there is both mouse turds and urine coating a pan you used a week ago; when you go to grab your coffee beans from a Tupperware container only to find a hole gnawed in the side and a mouse INSIDE the container, EATING the beans, it's time to use these traps!Before buying these traps, 20 at a time, we tried bate, a standard wire mouse trap, heck!, we even have three cats! But, a cat can't catch a mouse living inside your oven nor inside of a plastic container, so that's where these traps come in handy.I do realize that they are sad traps to use and my heart breaks whenever a wee mousie is trapped, but it's either risking our health through contamination of feces and urine or killing the mice; sadly, WE win and the MOUSE looses!I bate these traps with bits of crushed potato chips and that acts like a magnet for any mouse in the house. Usually we have 10 traps set up at a time all over the kitchen/bathroom, which is the area of our farm house that has settled the most over the root cellar. I have the traps either taped down with blue \"painter's tape\" so they can't move all over the place, trying to get free. And out of the deepest respect for the poor mouse, once trapped, I cover it with a paper towel to cover the remainder of the glue board, place the mouse into a plastic bag, and then place the poor thing into a deep freeze we have in the garage. Within 15 minutes, I've euthanized it as kindly as I can, into a deep sleep. And then into the trash bin it goes. This is also the ONLY trap that can catch and keep VOLES, some of the nastiest most destructive vermin living! We had an endless stream of voles gnaw right through our breezeway into our home and the cats wouldn't even touch them! After ridding ourselves of the voles, we had to completely reframe the outside and inside door trim, which they chewed through like tissue paper!I hate that I need to kill something living in order to provide a sanitary/safe place for my family. But, when Autumn comes and we are catching 3-4 mice per day for weeks at a time, we simply must choose our quality of life vs. theirs. Sorry, mice. :("

        "text": "I've used both a light Earthwise battery string trimmer and a Stihl gas trimmer.  I fully expected this unit to be tougher than the light battery trimmer, but I didn't expect it to blow the gas trimmer away.  It did, in spades.  I live in the country and have pasture fence lines, banks and other troublesome areas to trim.  I love the little Earthwise trimmer for grass and light weeds around the barn, house and yard, but don't expect it to do any hard stuff.  On the other hand it's gotten to where I don't want to use the gas trimmer anymore at all because it can't handle the firmer stemmed things like poke weeds or briars along fence lines, which means I also have to go over most of those areas with the Stihl blade trimmer (which doesn't cut the long grass).It's gotten so starting the gas trimmers is hard for me and since I have to stop and rest regularly, I either have to restart them too often or they just run out of gas, so the trimming just wasn't getting done in all the difficult places.  I was learning to live with the overgrowth.  I decided to give this thing a try and am really amazed.When I got the box, I was worried about how heavy it was (that battery weighs a good 5 lbs), but it turned out that the weight is well balanced and although heavier than the light Earthwise unit, is a lot easier to use than I anticipated.  It comes fully assembled except for putting on the helper handle which is easy and requires no tools.  You put it where it's most comfortable for you.  The red string guard has to be put on as well, but fits in position easily and the screws are already started in place.  You just need a Phillips screwdriver to finish the job.  There is already string installed. There is a direction book, but I didn't need it.  Everything is intuitive.  My first battery charge took two hours to reach full power.So out to give it a try.  I was not kind, pretty mean actually, running it through mixed combinations of weedy stuff from very thick new spring growth, to leftover stems from last year.  It was far more powerful than the gas trimmer and ripped through some pretty tough stuff.  The line is surprisingly strong and in my entire session I only had to bump it to extend the line four times.  Consider that I was using the trimmer up against fence posts, sapling stumps, trellis supports and all manner of other 'hazards'.  While the trimmer couldn't cut the woody stems of some things like young trees that had gotten hold in the last couple of years, it managed most things including young blackberry canes, young poke weeds and what was left of last year's growth.  Sometimes it jammed briefly, but then started right back up again when freed from the troublesome area.  It even restarted fine after getting into some wire that wrapped around the head.  I got the wire off and it was good to go again.Regarding battery life.  I really tried to run it out, but it ran me out and was still going strong.  I cut a bank that is too steep for the tractor that is about 80' long and 2-3' wide.  It has folded over mounds of grass from years of not being cut plus new spring growth.  It's really thick, but no match for this trimmer.  Then I trimmed about 100' of fence line that required passes on both sides.  I can't get the tractor closer than about 18\" to 2' on one side and the growth along there includes everything from spring weeds and poke weeds to briars and would be trees, cedars and maples.  The trimmer did a creditable job of getting rid of most, if not all of it.  I did a few more projects and kept looking for others, but I finally gave up too tired to move.  I expect the trimmer had been on about 40 minutes although all together with my moving around and resting I'd been at for easily twice that long.  After reading the product description here, I see variable speed is possible, but I had it running full bore the whole time.  Guess I could read the book :). (note: I did read the book and found the most cool thing: there's a button on the back of the battery I hadn't noticed.  When you press it, it shows how much battery charge you have left.  I wish all batteries had that feature.)It certainly is nice to have the thing stop when you release the trigger and restart instantly when you're ready to go again. When you're ready for a recharge, you press the appropriate spot the battery pack ejects and is easy to remove.  I hadn't run it completely out, but I must have been close and still it recharged fully in less than two hours.I can't speak to changing the line since I haven't had to do that yet and although I had the edging guide down part of the time to keep away from the fence posts as much as possible, didn't try actual edging, so I can't speak to that either.  My overall impression is that this trimmer is well worth the price.  It certainly isn't cheap, but is powerful enough to do really hard work, is easy to operate and has a long battery life.  For me it will take the place of both my gas string trimmer and blade trimmer.  And it will actually get used!"

First, it has a long arm that's balanced; it's easy to hold.  The material is even flexible so that it's unlikely to break.  Next, the trigger is earlier to hold than triggers on others I've tried.  Finally, the battery (I have the 4.0 Ah) lasts long enough for me to cut my very small yard and still not have to recharge for the next use.The battery is definitely heavier than those of my old trimmer.  It's worth it to me though because the machine I had been using for two years wasn't worth a darn.  Another difference is that the power output for this Oregon unit is constant.  There seems to be no fade which is what I had experienced from the beginning with my old trimmer."

        "text": "When moving into my house nearly ten years ago, I first started with a corded trimmer. Untangling and tripping over the cord was a massive irritation, not to mention having to attach several of them together to reach the farthest corners of my backyard.So I upgraded to theBlack & Decker LST220 12-Inch 20-Volt Lithium-Ion Cordless GrassHog Trimmer/Edger. This was a major improvement and I was happy with it until I got my hands on the GreenWorks Cordless Lithium-Ion String Trimmer/Edger. The longer shaft and adjustable handle on the GreenWorks made all the difference. The sturdiness and longer battery life were nice too, but I found the balance was slightly off and the trimmer head was never quite at the ideal angle for my arm length (even though it was somewhat adjustable).Two years later, I was introduced to the OREGON Cordless ST275-A6. It was like upgrading from a Toyota to a Lexus. Both very good in their own right, but the OREGON is more refined.I say refined, but in a sense it's simpler. No pivoting head, auto line feed or guide wheels. But I found I didn't need them. The OREGON is balanced and positioned perfectly for my long arms. The bump feed makes for an extra step, but gives you control over how much line you use (plus a more simplified system means cheaper repairs if it breaks down). The dual line increases efficiency by providing a cleaner cut and is better for thick overgrown grass. And because there are two lines, it keeps the vibration level at a minimum, which is great for people using this professionally -- less nerve trauma at the end of a long day. The best part, for me, is the large grip handle. Surprisingly, this was a commonly flawed feature on all the trimmers I've previously tried. But the OREGON got it perfectly! Sturdy, comfortable grip, ideal height, and can be positioned on -- rotate and slide up or down -- the shaft exactly how I want it.If you cut lawns professionally, or just want a better experience in your own backyard, then I recommend giving this OREGON a try."

        "text": "The Oregon MAX Trimmer/Edger  is my second foray into the world of battery-powered trimmers.  I bought a Core CGT400 trimmer last summer and I ended up returning it due to a faulty trim head.  The Core worked pretty well but didn't have power to match a gas powered trimmer.  The Oregon MAX falls into the same category; it works well, but the thick St. Augustine grass in Texas does cause you to have to walk slowly and sometimes you have to go back over the same area twice.PROs-------------------+ light and well balanced+ battery lasts a long time and holds its charge when stored+ no cords and no smelly gas+ terrific edging guide featureCONs-------------------- underpowered compared to a gas trimmer- small cut area compared to other trimmers I've usedThe unit only has 4\" of exposed trim line (though it is double-sided from the trim head).  This is 2\" less than my Honda gas trimmer and 1\" less than the Core CGT400.  I assume the cutting area is reduced so that the motor doesn't get bogged down due to insufficient of power.  The problem with this design compromise is that it slows you down because the cutting area isn't as large as other trimmers.Fortunately, the slower trimming is tolerable because the Oregon MAX is lightweight and the battery lasts a really long time.  I trimmed/edged 800 linear feet of curb and fence of my corner lot and the power held steady the entire time.  The battery has an LED indicator that tells you how much charge remains.  After 800 feet of cutting, the 4Ah battery indicated that it was half charged.  Impressive!The Oregon MAX is well balanced and easy to maneuver.  Being quite light, and having a long reach, it doesn't tire you out during long jobs.  The bump head works well and advances string readily without kinking.  It is a dual-line model which allows you to do more cutting for the same RPMs.The most outstanding feature of this trimmer is the edging guide.  A metal guide swings down and you simply pull the trigger to full RPMs and slide this guide along your curb and you will get the straightest, most perfect, edging I've ever seen from a hand-held trimmer.  It is amazing and it's a feature I wish every trimmer had.  Even edging the thick St. Augustine grass worked pretty well.  The relatively thin line did break off a bit often, but I plan on installing thicker line in the future.The handle was very easy to adjust to a position that worked for either edging or trimming.  Once I got it \"just right\", I could go back and forth between trimming and edging without pause.One thing I noticed while edging is that the debris guard is not that helpful.  The edger threw up a cloud of dust and I was covered in dirt by the time I was done.The battery uses lithium ion technology and holds its charge between uses.  That is really handy as you can charge it and then let it sit without worrying that it will be dead the next time need it.The unit is very well built and seems like it will last a long time.If you live in a part of the country with \"normal\" grass, the Oregon MAX will have plenty of power to quickly handle big trimming and edging jobs.  With rugged St. Augustine \"grass\" (really a vine) in Texas, the Oregon MAX is a bit out-classed.  That said, if you want something light and cord-free, I definitely recommend the Oregon MAX.  And the edging feature is pretty darn cool."

The shaft on this Oregon trimmer is longer than that of the B&D trimmer and the battery assembly on the back balances the weight of the trimmer at the other end, which reduces fatigue. The trim line is a durable cable, which requires less fuss and replacement than the plastic line of the B&D trimmer. I find the power to comparable to a gas trimmer. I have used it to edge and trim not only grass but also perennials and tougher weeds and it has done the job well."

The gloves I&#8217;ve been using were fabric that was coated with a heat resistant material. They worked, but the safe temp limit was about 200 degrees, which meant while I could pick up food with them, I could not use them as general heat protection mitts.These, however, are made of silicone and have a far higher temp resistance while still making it possible to use them to pick up food. They do have some quirks &#8211; the silicone is sticky, which can make it a bit tricky to get them on your hands. But, a little finger wiggling and stretching the silicone gets the job done. They are also short &#8211; they don&#8217;t go past my wrist. A longer extension would be a useful addition.Finger and hand mobility with them on is decent. They are more than limber enough to allow me to pick up not only food, but roasts and kitchen tools. Cleanup is simple &#8211; with the gloves on, drizzle some dish detergent and then wash your &#8220;hands&#8221; under water. Quick and easy!These would be perfect if they had a cloth liner to make it easier to put on, and an extension cuff (also fabric) to protect forearms from spatters.

Perhaps the main difference in is that these gloves are not lined.  If you never did like those or dislike the feel of silicone, simply take a pass.When I took the grill gloves out of the box, I have to quickly pull them apart, or fluff them up to keep the the fingers and palm from sticking to the opposite side.  It was very quick work and not at all problematic.  I&#8217;d say I have medium women&#8217;s hands, somewhat average.  When I put on the gloves I tapped down between each finger and the pointer after pulling on the cuff of the glove to get a nice snug fit.  By doing that, the EpicDeluxe grill gloves fit much better and I didn&#8217;t have to struggle to get them on.Fit?  Well, just a guesstimate, but I&#8217;d say a women&#8217;s medium to a man&#8217;s large would be the best fit for these gloves.  Anyone with extra large finger or wide hands many have trouble putting them on.  On the other hand if you have very small hands you&#8217;ll swim in them.  They are nicely textured with miniature orange hearts that give the gloves really nice gripping power.  They flex quite easily and I was able to manage working with them on the stovetop and in the oven.I&#8217;m not a BBQ person, but using these in the kitchen work quite nicely as well.  I had no problem pulling out oven racks, a feature I really like, or moving pans.  Unless you have reason to use them for hours on end, they are quite comfortable.  When I was through using them, they were very easy to remove and place on the counter.The EpicDeluxe grill gloves are multi-purpose ones and definitely protect the hands.  Simply keep in mind the size of your hands or those of the person you are purchasing for and you&#8217;ll be very happy with these ultra-functional, multi-purpose grilling gloves.Sample provided for review."

In fact, I used them to actually turn over meat that I was broiling just to see if they were everything the product description claimed. They are. I also plucked a potato out of a boiling pot to test it in a more dynamic environment than the inside of an oven. No discomfort.While these are amazing and a lot safer than regular oven mitts, there are a few issues of which you need to be aware. Foremost is I do not have big hands by any stretch of the imagination and had to pull these on almost like you would for surgical gloves. Once I managed to wiggle my hands into them they were comfortable and gave me the flexibility to pick up most kitchen utensils.  If you have large hands you may be in for a struggle.While it may take some effort to wear these gloves, the improved safety is worth it in my opinion. I have had oven mitts actually burn using them indoors in a kitchen oven, so can only imagine what would have happened outdoors on an open flame with a grill. These gloves eliminate that particular risk."

        "text": "The seller sent me a pair of these at no cost in exchange for writing a review. I gave them away. Here's why.1. Because silicone sticks to itself, when I first opened the package a number of glove fingers were stuck together so I had to pry them apart. I never fully succeeded with one of the gloves, where the thumb and forefinger were not something I could fully get my hand into.2. Taking these on and off was a bit of a chore. And standing in a hot sun in front of the grill my hands became uncomfortably warm wearing these because they retain the heat.3. Yes, these did provide protection against the heat of my gas grill. But I found them awkward to use and uncomfortable to wear, and finally just took them off. I much prefer my standard oven mitts, which are much thinner (though just as effective), more comfortable, and easier to take on and off.Bottom line: These work, but are bulkier and less comfortable than traditional oven mitts. Definitely not for me."

I spend a lot of time standing out there watching my meals cook, so it's always fun to bring another gizmo to the scene and see if I can't improve things a little bit.  I have some really nice low-voltage light fixtures built into my patio overhead to light up my grill, but my wife's climbing roses grow too tall and cover the lights, so I keep having to improvise to see what I'm cooking.  I've been using a head lamp strapped to my noggin, but this is way better.This light clamps onto the handle of your grill hood and then adjusts down to illuminate your grill.  It has two good sized arrays of five LEDs (sorry for the word problem: that's ten LEDs).You'll need a tiny Phillips head screwdriver to open the battery cover and install the three AA batteries (included).The light fixture itself creates a nice spot of light to illuminate your grill.  The size of the spot of light depends on the height of your hood.  It easily adjusts from side to side and front to back, so you can aim it around if your grill is too big for it to cover all at once.I don't like to leave things like this exposed to the elements, so I removed it and stored it in the cabinet under the grill when I was done.  I squirted the tension knob screw with a little WD40 to make it easier to quickly install/remove it.All in all, this is a sturdy accessory that provides a lot of helpful light for cooking.  I'm glad I won't have to wear my headlamp anymore.I was provided this item for review."

More on this later.Yes this is a great lamp for grilling as everyone has pointed out - but it is also a good thing to keep in your car  to aid you if you ever get a flat tire.  It makes a perfect lamp to attach to you headboard and read by.  It is perfect to attach near your entrance door for those nights that you forgot to turn on the outside light and are fumbling with your keys and packages. It is better than walking though the dark with a flashlight since women can simply attach it to their purse handle (if it is thick enough) A simple tap turns this very bright; almost flood-light like lamp on.It is good if you need a concentrated beam of light when you are working on some household projects.  The head moves up and down, but does not swivel, but it can still help when you need both hands to handle tools and a flashlight won't cut it.Unfortunately for some of these uses the batteries don't last long enough.  Which is okay if you use rechargeable batteries and leave the battery cover off to make it easier to change them out.I experimented and found that I had gotten about 3 hours of non-stop light - this is perfect when used for its intended purpose - but not quite long enough for reading.  Too bad that it is not rechargeable!So all in all this is a great product to use for what it was meant to do, but is also good to have as a back up light in case of power outages.Sample sent for testing and reviewing purposes.i"

To open the battery compartment, you will need a small Phillips screwdriver.  Do not forget to put the ribbon under the batteries because the battery well is deep.  When it is time to replace the batteries, you just pull the ribbon and the batteries come out.The light can pivot in a wide range of angles both vertically and horizontally.  The on/off button is soft touch.  Just tap it lightly with your finger to operate.  This is a great feature as the location of the button is completely flat; you can just wipe it to clean.Limitation:This is good when you grill with the lid open because that is where you clamp the light on.  If you have to close the lid often then it is a hassle to keep removing and clamping back the light.  The solution is to have another place close to the grill to anchor the light on.Other uses:You can use the light wherever you have a pole or an edge where you can clamp the light on.  Great for camping, garage, or even as an emergency car flashlight.Suggestion: This can be made better if the screw thread is wider apart so you don't have to turn the knob too many times to clamp (or unclamp) the light.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes."

This model this model is lightweight and comes with a plastic sheath with pen clip. The packaging says that the measuring range of this thermometer is -58F-572F.There are three buttons on the thermometer, a hold button, the on/off button and the degrees Celsius/degrees Fahrenheit button. You have to press down firmly on the on/off button to get the thermometer to turn on. My only dislike in this thermometer is that the buttons are very small and I found myself having to use a fingernail to get them to work as my finger was too large and sometimes I would hit the other buttons. This is why deducted one star. Within seconds you are ready to take the temperature of your favorite cut of meat.  I compared the readings with this thermometer to another digital thermometer I had and they were both within a tenth of a degree. The feature I like best about this thermometer is the hold button. Before withdrawing the thermometer from the food, when you press the hold button it will hold the temperature reading until it is pressed again. This prevents the thermometer's temperature to fall drastically when testing another part of the meat. It also has a nice battery saving feature as it will turn itself off after 45 minutes if no buttons are pressed. It also has a nice chart on the back of the packaging  to tell you what the proper temperature of each of your meats should be.Overall, this is a great value for the price. Bacteria doesn't stand a chance.Sample for review."

No one wants bloody chicken, but no one wants dried out chicken either. Free range chickens especially can dry out if not yanked out of the oven at the exact moment of perfection because they're not fattened up or pumped full of saline.This little thing gives you a clear readout and you don't have to wait around for the little needle to move around on the old fashioned round thermometer with the oven door open letting all of the heat out. This thing tells you PRONTO what the temp is, so you can get on with your life.I don't know what more to say other than it rinses clean, it seems to be very accurate and well made."

        "text": "This Gogogu Instant-read Digital BBQ Thermometer is reasonably priced and is a pretty good value for the money. It tested accurate within a degree for both ice water and boiling water and reads within a degree or two of other kitchen thermometers I own. It is also reasonably priced at under ten dollars. So, if you are buying this thermometer primarily for testing meat in the kitchen, it's going to do the job and do it reasonably well.However, it's a rather basic thermometer. Its display is fairly small and requires me to use my reading glasses. (I have two kitchen thermometers with a much larger display with 1/2 inch digits. These are extremely easy to read, even without my glasses.)The on-off, C/F, and Hold buttons are quite small and very close together. I found that working these buttons was a bit awkward and required a good deal of pressure to get them to work.Finally, the probe is just 5 inches long, which will be adequate for some purposes, but will be a bit short for getting into the center of large piece of meat, such as a whole turkey. Also, for testing the temperature of meat on an outdoor grill it's nice to have a longer probe so one can keep one's hand further away from the heat.Of course, you're going to pay more for a thermometer with a longer probe, a larger display, and more features. So, if you just want a basic thermometer that will do the job, this is the one to buy.Note: I received this product in exchange for writing an honest review.

This thermometer is  pretty simple to use, and although it comes with instructions on the package it is still pretty self explanatory. Press the on off button to turn it on, it flashes on and starts off in the Celsius mode. Press the little C/F button to switch to Fahrenheit if  desired, then insert probe into thickest part of meat without touching bone , and read temperature. It is fairly quick to come up to temperature at first, but those last few tenths of a degree get a little slow, which is not a problem as for most of us a few tenths of a degree are negligible.If you want to remember that temperature, keep the probe in the meat and press the Hold button , it will hold that temperature in its memory until pressed again, unless you turn off the unit. It is easy to clean with a soapy damp cloth, but not submergible. And it comes with a little probe cover that has a clip on it, much like the clip on a pen, so you can keep it secure in a pocket until needed."

Really, the only thing that the Taylor has over this one is the NSF certification, which can actually be pretty important.  This Gogodu does NOT state that it is NSF certified.  As far as temperatures, Gogogu and the NSF certified Taylor were always with 0.6 degrees (F) of each other.  However, NSF certifies not just the measurement, but also that the design meets the standards for being able to clean (from my vantage, this Gogogu is just as cleanable as the Taylor.)  The one thing that I can't vouch for is that NSF would have verified is that it is non-toxic, durable and resistant to corrosion.  Time will tell for the latter two, I'll just hope this sucker isn't toxic.So, from my \"layman's\" perspective on this thermometer, it's great...but having the NSF certification would have made it even nicer.  All in all, this appears to be a good all-around product.  Lastly, as far as being waterproof - both this one and my Taylor say they are waterproof.  I take this to mean that I can get a soapy sponge, clean the entire thing, rinse it off, and move on...and they both work fine with that.  I don't (and have no plans to) put these into a sink of soapy water, nor a dishwasher...Disclaimer:  I received this product free of change from the manufacturer in exchange for an honest review."

Digital read-out is easy to see.  Temperature range is broad and can show either C or F.  The thermometer fits into its sleeve snugly, and won't accidentally slide out.At first, it looked like my fingers would be too large to accurately turn the three buttons on and off, so I used my fingernails.  That did not work too well and it was hit or miss if the button switched or not.  After a minute of playing with the buttons, I learned that despite the size if my fingertips, they were the best and most reliable tool to switch the buttons.  So, when using my finger tips, the buttons switch every time.  If you have very long fingernails, the end of the sleeve is handy and works every time, too.The face of the thermometer has a thin film of plastic on it to protect the face during assembly and packaging:  It is hard to see that it is there.

I tested my review sample by taking my own temperature (careful to not pierce my tongue in the process) and it came up with a perfect 98.6 degree Fahrenheit, which I validated by taking my temperature with a clinical thermometer and getting the same results.I am not going to rehash the specs and description. I will say that this is an accurate and reasonably priced instrument that does have a few minor issues. First, mine would not turn on when I pressed the on/off switch, so I opened the top casing to get to the battery. I pushed the battery firmly into the holder and the thermometer activated when I tried the switch the second time.The problem I had was not so much opening the case or activating the battery, but getting the top of the readout display back on the body of the unit. After much fumbling I saw that there is a guide hold in the bottom part of the case and a peg in the top. After aligning them (difficult because the case blocks the view when you start closing it), I was able to seat the top and start using the thermometer. For this I subtracted a star because the instructions printed on the back of the retain packaging did not mention it, and it's not obvious at first glance. It may be a clever design, but it's not a consumer friendly one.Despite that issue I do love the accuracy, the fact that it displays to one decimal place, and the tactile feedback from the small buttons. An added bonus for me is some recipes I use are based on Celsius and metric measurements. I have to convert them most of the time, but this thermometer defaults to C.  I can press a button to see what it is in F or the reverse, so that feature is one I love."

I loved them so much that I bought a second set so I'd have four of the skewers.First I have to confess that I haven't used the mats yet.  I haven't quite found the right use for them, plus I keep my grill pretty hot and these are only for use up to 500 degrees.  The skewers though, oh the skewers...I made a nice big set of kebabs for my family and quickly realized that I can't recall the last time I made kebabs.  Why not?  Because I've always had such horrible luck with them.  I have such a hard time turning the kebabs without just having the chunks of stuff twirl around on the skewers.  So the food cooks unevenly and a lot of the pieces even fall off.  That's no good at all.  But these skewers loop around on themselves to make a complete ring, which means that it's very simple to turn them over:  just grab the pointy end with your tongs and gently turn the whole business over (use a spatula to support the other end if you're worried about being too rough with them).These wire skewers are nice and long.  Each one is the equivalent of two or two and a half of the regular wooden skewers that we typically use.  So each one makes a perfect serving for one family member.I had a few fears with these loopy skewers:1) They'd be too hot to handle.2) They'd be too tough to clean.3) They'd be too unwieldy to store.I used tongs and a spatula to take everything off the grill.  Then I figured I'd need my heavy duty BBQ mitt to hold one end while I wrestled the kebabs off the lines, but by the time I got them into the kitchen and got down to business they had already cooled off.  Awesome!Then when it was time to do dishes I just soaped them up and used a sponge to scrub them.  They cleaned right up!When I was all done, I just coiled them up on themselves and they made a bundle about 6\" in diameter.  They fit in my BBQ cupboard just fine.Like I mentioned before, I got a set of these for free to evaluate, but I loved them so much that I bought another set so I'd have four for my family.  Adios wooden sticks!"

        "text": "Whoever designed this product obviously grills differently than how we do it in the US. These mats are not suitable for conventional outdoor grilling, where high heat and licks of flame are part of the process. These mats are suitable to use in place of parchment paper on your cookie sheets.I grill because I want to create nice crusty sear marks on my foods, whether it be steaks, burgers, kabobs, veggies, seafood or fish. Even when I need to cook foods at a lower-than-high temperature, I still start out by searing the outside. Why bother grilling if that is not the result you are looking for?When I grill over fire (wood or charcoal), even when I try to prevent flare-ups, they happen. And when I crank up the Weber gas grill, it heats to well-over 500 degrees before I toss on the food. Same with my Char Broil infrared grill.The mats are basically like a Silpat mat.Mats are NOT suitable for live fire grilling: Why? Because you can NOT allow flame to touch them.Mats are NOT suitable for searing: Why? Because you can NOT allow temperature to go over 500 degrees Fahrenheit.With these mats, you will definitely prevent your grill grates from getting messy, but you will never be able to create a Maillard Effect (caramelization), because you will never be able to get the mats hot enough to create a sear. And, if you've used a marinade, and if your food becomes juicy, the liquid will run off the mat because there is no lip....Hmmmm.....So you will still get flare-ups and you will still get your grates messy.ABOUT THE SKEWERS: They, also, are limited in use: The tips are rounded, not pointy and sharp for easy piercing. These rounded tips mangle delicate seafood and veggies. Forget trying to skewer tomatoes, onion rings, peppers or shrimp. Take a close look at the middle picture, you can see how rounded the tips are. Also, notice that the tips are a bigger diameter than the rest of the skewer. What that means is this: You thread the food over the tips and create a big hole. Then you slide it onto the very pliable thinner cable. Your food will definitely NOT hold in place. It swings around and flops around on the narrow cable, because it started out by going through a big hole.And I'm not sure how this replaces aluminum foil or how it can be used effectively for roasting: Foil wraps any way you want it to, and it can keep fluids contained so you don't lose the juices and so you don't dirty a pan. These mats are flat and will always be flat and fluid will run right off of it.All around this is a very bad idea for the grill.*I received a sample product from TeiKis for review, and I'm not a wimp and not afraid to hand out one-star reviews when they are warranted. If I had paid money for this crap, I would be livid right now. I don't regret spending the time writing a review on it--my ultimate goal is to help customers think through their decisions to buy, before they hit the buy-button, and before things get ugly when they open a package and are disappointed by what they find inside."

        "text": "You can think of these mats as  flexible pans...without sides. They're coated with PTFE which is similar to material used in non-stick pans. Perfect to take along to parks & campsites where the grills can be a disgusting mess. Of course, these mats can  be used at home to keep those little pieces from falling through the grates. And if you don't like barbecue sauce cooking onto your grate then this would be an option.  You can cook on either side.  They clean  easily with soap & water or in the dishwasher.  I'm thinking they might be useful in the bottom of my oven when I bake items that could spill over.These are handy items but they do come with restrictions: store flat, they cannot be placed over flames, should not be heated above 500 F & don't use sharp utensils on the mat.The stainless steel skewers are flexible so you can arrange them around the food that's cooking on the grill. But, the tips are  rounded which makes it hard to pierce food items.review sample provided"

        "text": "Pros:- Easy to clean. No doubt about that.  Not only that the mat is easy to clean because it performs like Teflon that almost nothing sticks into it, but the biggest advantage is it prevents your grill from getting dirty.  As you know the soot, the grease, etc. are one of the toughest grime to clean.- As long as you keep grease from dripping below, there is no flare-up.Cons:- You cannot let fire (or exceeds 500 degrees F) from touching the mat- Searing is almost impossible to achieve because you have to make sure you don't let the temperature exceed 500 degrees plus the fact that the mat practically converts the grill into an oversized frying pan.  The juices and the oil remains on the meat on the mat which makes it fried and not grilled.The skewer:It includes a pair of skewers.  The skewer might be the most durable skewer you will ever own (aside from a pure metal spits).  It is indestructible.  It is made of braided metal cable with solid metal tips.  The tip is rounded which makes it difficult to poke meat on it and makes big holes on veggies.  It is pretty long so you have to loop it or bend it around the grill surface to fit.  Also makes it hard to turn because the metal conducts heat. Lastly, I find pleasure on eating on a stick, which is something you probably find hard to do with a 27\" long skewer.A sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes."

        "text": "I got the chance to try out the TeiKis BBQ grill mat and metal skewers this weekend, and they worked out better than I expected. Keeping in mind that I'm not a BBQ expert (and I've never tried to grill veggies before), the results were pretty good.The sheets are a thin Teflon-based (PTFE-coated) pad that you toss on the BBQ to heat/roast/cook whatever you have in mind. I used it for veggies I had marinated in olive oil and balsamic vinegar. You have to make sure the pad is not exposed to open flame, nor used in temps over 500 degrees. When I got done with the grilling (complete with sizzling marinade), the veggies were nicely singed and soft. It's a little hard to work with the sheet right off the grill, as there's no real structure or stiffness to it. I had to scoop most of the veggies off with a spatula before I could grab the corners and pour the rest of the marinade into the bowl. Washing was a little strange (hand-washing), as it was hard to scrub it down to make it feel completely clean. On the next pass, I'll probably run it through the dishwasher.The skewers were a bit more iffy for me. It was better for larger chunks, as the &#34;sharp end&#34; is more blunt than the typical wooden skewers. I liked how you can shape the skewer around the grill based on the flexibility of the wire. I had to be careful when moving them around, as they *do* conduct heat better than wood. I also had to remove the food from the skewer before serving, as a looping wire doesn't quite have the same visual pizazz as individual wooden skewers.I'll definitely be adding more grilled veggies into my routine by using the TeiKis mats. I'm not sure how much I'll use the skewers, but I still like the idea of having them around if needed.Disclosure:Obtained From: RetailerPayment: Free"

Grill covers I have had in the past has been thick plastic that when the weather got cold, they were difficult to get on the grill because they lost some of their elasticity. They sometimes ripped when they got this cold. This cover, I think, will not have this problem.The reason is that the fabric material of this cover is very thin. Although it is lightweight, it does seem durable. The product description says that the microporous membrane technology provides 100% waterproof protection and enhanced breathability to prevent trapped moisture and that the corrode Blok Active Vapor Corrosion Inhibitor (VCI) Technology reduces rust and corrosion, extending the life of your grill. I hope that this is the case. It fits very nicely over my Weber Spirit E-310. It has Velcro straps on both ends of the grill to keep the cover snug and keep it from blowing off.I will update the review next spring to let you know how well it held up during a western NY winter."

As it turned out just on the basis of fit alone I like this better than my Weber cover which was very expensive and more tailored which caused some problems when it came to putting it on or taking off. This is a well made cover which offers nearly 100% coverage except for clearage near the wheels.This promises to prevent rusting. I can't attest to that claim because my grill is not rusted and having it for a couple days in summer is no test. I can tell you that having a cover appears to have kept my grill from rusting since my grill had been covered when not in use.I am just happy to have a cover which seems substantial and is easy to take off and on because it drapes over the grill instead of having a tight fit.Overall, this is a nice product that promises to fit a grill that measures no more than 5 feet."

        "text": "When this thing arrived on my doorstep, I was quite surprised because in the package, it is so small and light that I didn&#8217;t think it could be a grill cover. It looked about the size of a small canvas shopping bag and was no heavier, either. But once opened, it unfolded into a crisp, light, expansive grill cover, which I put to work immediately on my barrel-shaped, iron charcoal grill.The cover fit right over the top with plenty of room to spare, and because it is so light, I had some qualms about how I might fasten it to keep it from blowing away. Fortunately, it has two sets of Velcro closures, one at each end of the cover, which allowed me to tighten its grip on my grill and hold the cover in place. The roominess also gives me enough space to accommodate the attached smoker chimney without compromising the length and therefore, still able to cover both front and back of the grill all the way down to the deck top. The cover looks great and I love the color, texture and lightness. Because it is so roomy, removing it was a breeze as well and the lightweight fabric makes it easy to fold up and store until you are ready to pop it back over the grill. And sure, all it has to do is keep the rain and bugs out, but, it&#8217;s doing that, so as long as it looks nice, there&#8217;s nothing much I can complain about.Amazon requires that I assess this product within 30 days, so I&#8217;m not able to comment on the purported rust proofing capabilities, but since it is a Rustoleum product, I have no reason to doubt the claim. As a matter of fact, with the onset of rust quite noticeable  on my charcoal grill, I have every expectation that this grill cover will prolong the grill&#8217;s serviceable life. At the very least, it looks good, is well made and easily fits over my grill, so I have no reason to give it less than the full five stars."

And despite it being so light weight it survived some very high winds during a recent storm (with hail) the other day. The claims about UV and rust are too early to tell. However, so far so good. I am impressed with this grill cover so far and in my opinion I think the claims will hold up.This is expensive (though I received the cover without charge to give an honest review).

The true test of a grill cover is how well it protects the grill and how long its protection lasts.  I can see that, so far, it's doing a good job of protecting both grills simultaneously.  By the end of the hot, humid Texas summer, I should have a fairly good idea of how long it will last, because any cover that's able to withstand several months of obnoxious heat will probably last for more than a year.  Time will tell, and, should it crash from the heat, I'll update this review.FOUR STARS!UPDATE:  July 22, 2014After less than three weeks, this grill cover has separated at the seams.

We leave our grill out and covered 24/7 12 months of the year because we use it until it's buried so deep in the snow that we can't get to it anymore.  Plastic covers are useless - they tear easily and rot pretty fast in the sun. The 2 ton canvas one we had last worked ok for covering the grill but it was heavy, got rotten after about 3 years and I think, because it kept the air off the grill, contributed to the rust problem we had.This cover is so light weight that at first I was afraid it would just blow off but, wonder of wonders, they actually put velcro in exactly the right places on the ends to tighten the fabric and hold it in place.

I was apprehensive about the durability of one so lightweight, but since the others have only marginally held up, I was anxious to give this one a try. I like that there&#8217;s a non-toxic barrier to corrosion and UV protection. The light weight makes it easy to put on and remove, and there are Velcro straps to keep it snugged down in windy weather.Time will tell how durable it will be, but I&#8217;m happy with it and the neutral color looks ever so much better on our deck and against the newly painted house."

First I tried it on the lawn tractor.  It covered everything except the wheels just fine, and stayed in place great.  It just fit, so it wouldn't fit a larger tractor.Next, I tried it on the grill.  This is an average-sized, 50\" wide 3-burner grill.  It fit over the top okay, though it didn't quite cover the base.  It was about 1-2\" too short.  Then I tried fastening the velcro straps on each side just under the side shelves to keep it in place.  On one side they fastened fine, but on the other the slightest pull on one and it came right off.  As a test I tried the other also - it came off with only a little more force, a little less than what it takes to tear a sheet of paper out of a spiral notebook.The picture on the product page doesn't match the one I received.  For one thing, it doesn't show the 2 straps on each side, so maybe they were a last minute change; without them the cover can slide around, and might even blow off in windy conditions, esp. on small to medium grills.  The side without the straps is billowing a bit right now outside in moderate wind.  Also, the seams on mine are completely different.  The fabric looks similar, but mine has heat welding seals all along the bottom edge.I pulled the cover out to one side and measured it; it would just barely fit a 60\" wide grill of average depth and height, though it might be a very tight fit.The material itself seems medium-weight, has heat-welded seems and a cloth feel.  It will probably last several years (except for the straps)."

I don't know how many times our burgers were either over cooked and dry, or mostly raw( not that I mind an ultra rare burger now and again) only because the limited evening Autumn or Winter light got away from us.That won't happen for me now.This light is easy to install, is simple to turn on and off with just a slight touch, and does the trick to illuminate my grill completely.One of the nicer features is, that once it's installed, you can swivel the light around. And because it casts such a wide and bright beam of light, after you are done grilling, you could swivel it around to help illuminate your sitting area. You could also attach it to a patio umbrella or stair railing, or even a tree branch ,and use it that way to light up another area.This little light packs some power, and it only uses 3 AA batteries, which were not included."

Hinges on the light hold position nicely and allow all angles.Love the touch-sensitive on/off switch!C-clamp bracket will accommodate up to a 1 1/2&#34; diameter round handle.  (Be aware that if your handle is that big, the tightening knob will stick out about 1 1/2&#34;, too.)It takes three AA batteries--not included.  To install the batteries you need a tiny Philips head screwdriver to remove the battery compartment cover.  Most everyone will have a tiny screwdriver like this, except maybe for those just starting out with any empty tool box.  (Eventually you will need one, so don't let not having one prevent you from getting this light.  I just mention it so you can get one ready in advance.)*I received a sample product from the distributor."

The product photos show a few uses too.Turn it on by tapping the painted on/off switch on top of the light.It lights up the entire grill area, but it's not just for grilling, we  found several uses for it...hubby sometimes uses it as a work light.At one point, we didn't think we'd be able to get the battery cover off. The screw is very tight & requires a small Phillips head screw driver to remove it. Hubby has more patience that I do, and he finally got the cover off.Nice product, with many uses.review sample provided"

        "text": "It seemed proper to open with a Jimmy Reed lyric in my title because the light this puts out is pretty bright. When I was offered a review sample I did not have grilling in mind. The clamp looked like it would fit a microphone stand and that is what inspired me to undertake a review.When I first received it I could not believe that the on/off marking on the top of the lamp was a real switch. It looked as though it was painted on the casing, but someone forgot the switch. After loading it with batteries a mere touch of the marking switches the light on and off. It's pretty clever actually and one of the reasons why I gave it five stars.The battery compartment requires a small Phillips head screwdriver to access the compartment. It's a pain, but it has a purpose: it keeps the compartment waterproof. I tested that by actually submerging the light in a sink basin filled with water. It remained lit and was no worse from my experiment after I removed it and dried it off. So if you do use this for outdoors grilling and forget to bring it back in, it will probably survive the elements for months.I use mine as a handy flashlight that I can conveniently affix to a mic stand. When I need to illuminate a section of a dimly lit stage, a few turns on the clamp screw releases it and I can use it as a conventional flashlight. It is actually strong enough to be a close-in work light for minor repairs in the dark. In fact, it has a lot of uses far beyond what it was designed to do.Normally I donate review samples after I evaluate them, but this one is a keeper."

        "text": "I'm pretty lucky - various companies keep asking to review their products.  I ignore about 70% of these requests - not my thing. The remaining products I pick because it's something I can actually use. I BBQ about 10 times a month. We're late eaters, so it's often after dark. I've tried solar landscape lights and goose-neck lights, headlamps and penlights gripped in my teeth.This light is simply great. It clamps on to the lid-handle and is designed to point over and down to the grilling surface. It has a capacitance button, so there's no physical switch. On my large Weber it lights the entire grill evenly and with plenty of light. I tried the light indoors - it nicely lit a 12x24 foot room!  Again, it's a flood - not a spot, so it's a very wide beam. There's two clusters of five LED lights powered by 3 AA batteries (not included.)One thing to be aware of: It is NOT waterproof. I left it out in the rain and it filled with water. Had to dismantle and let dry so it would work again."

That&#8217;s a pain. When the lights go out, the last thing you want to do is hunt around for your little screwdriver just to change the batteries. A snap-on/snap-off type of lid would have been much better.But that&#8217;s it! Everything else about this grill light is awesome!  It only takes three batteries and pumps out a decent amount of light for a long time. The official count is 20 hours, although I haven&#8217;t timed that myself. It mounts easily to a number of surfaces, including the intended grill lid. The touch on/touch off switch is great and easy to use.Like many people, I sues this grill light for more than just grilling. I took it camping with me last weekend and mounted it to a tree light to give some additional light to the table when we were cooking at night. You can even carry it around as a flashlight if you need to. Very useful.Sample supplied for review."

I then used one in my left hand to hold the meat in place while I carved the meat with a knife in my right hand. Worked great.They work really well on the barbecue to move meat around. I also slow cooked a pork butt on the BBQ and then shredded the meat with these claws.

I mean seriously these things are practically self defense weapons disguised as meat claws. My only concern for using them with the BBQ grill is you really risk burning your hands a little bit if something is to slip.  I'll report back if I have any real issues with this over the summer.These things would be excellent painted silver for Wolverine cosplay! If the zombie apocalypse ever happens I think I found my new weapon of choice.If you know somebody who likes the barbecue and slow cooked meats for 10 bucks these are perfect gift. Plus they're just wicked cool looking and you'll feel like a bad ass using them.Thanks for reading!"

This works great for pulled meat sandwiches that are so much better when homemade with your own sauce, seasonings etc!To use this for making several do ahead freezer meals at once:What I did was to make a full roast (chicken or whatever meat I want) then pull the meat to use the meat in different meals. This puller allow me to do this. It is very effective in pork roasts, chicken anytime I want to keep my cooked meat in a zip-lock bag for a later meal.What I do is to divide my pulled meat into portions and place them in separate zip-lock bags and then label and freeze them. On busy days, I just remove the desired bag from my freezer, defost and heat up and my meat is ready to eat in no time!This is a great way to prepare several meals of meat ahead and place in the freezer.Highly recommend this.[Note: This item was provided to me for an unbiased review].

        "text": "The Ouddy meat claws are much better and easier to use than the metal bear claw lifters with only four tines. Those are probably better for lifting rather that flipping and shredding. These meat claws have six sturdy tines and even though they aren&#8217;t made of metal, do a great job shredding meat. They also work well for holding down a piece of meat while slicing.I haven&#8217;t tried scooping charcoal in or out of the grill, but no doubt they would work well for that. The tines themselves are approximately 1-3/4&#8221; long and the entire &#8220;paw&#8221; is a full 4-1/4&#8221; wide. The tips of the tines are quite sharp and easily stab and hold anything I tried. The plastic is quite solid and I was easily able to grip and work them both in tandem. No learning curve here.If you are into pork pulling and are no pro with a couple of forks, these will work quite nicely. I even tried using them as mixers and even though they are shorter than a salad fork and spoon set, they worked quite well. Actually a bit better because I was able to toss a salad quickly and easily. Less lettuce and salad fixings were rolling off to the side because these claws are wide. A bit of an unconventional use for the Ouddy meat claws, but whatever works.There are probably a ton of uses for the Ouddy claws and I saw a couple of interesting suggestions here and there. For example, one was for grabbing potatoes out of the oven. I don&#8217;t know how many times I&#8217;ve burned my fingers snagging baked potatoes out of the oven. I think the Ouddy meat claws, which aren&#8217;t solely for use with meats, will be making their way into my cupboard to try next time there&#8217;s a turkey in the oven.Sample provided for review."

We do a lot of smoking around here, and this has made picking through and shredding up several pork butts at a time a complete breeze.This is also handy to move chickens. It worked wonderfully on our turkey breast as well, and it worked without it being punctured or falling apart.I'm also fairly certain I could fend off an attacker with these claws if I had to, as they are pretty pointy and sharp.

If I use two knives to do the job faster, it cuts the meat instead of shredding it.  When I received a complimentary set of Ouddy Meat Claws for testing and review, I knew right away that these would work great!  As it turns out, I had roasted a chicken the day before they arrived.  I used these claws to shred the leftover chicken and I'm amazed!  The claws fit really well in my hands, and the claws are sharp and strong enough to make quick work of shredding meat.  Since they pull off small bits and don't cut the meat, I was left with a pile of truly shredded chicken meat.  They hand washed easily, and are small enough to store stacked in a drawer when not in use.  I'm also looking forward to using them to lift chickens and turkeys from the roasting pan, without burning myself or dropping the bird and splashing myself with the hot juices.And in the off-chance that some passing thief smells your BBQ and breaks in, you can go all Wolverine on them with these claws and save your shredded meat!
